<p>Hello, and welcome to my "summer update" on my free software work on FreeCAD
and the Debian Science team. I call it a summer update because it was winter
when I last wrote, and quite some time has elapsed since I fell out of the
monthly update habit. This is a high-level summary of what I've been working on
since March.</p>
<div class="section" id="freecad-0-18-release-debian-10-full-freeze-timing">
<h2>FreeCAD 0.18 Release &amp; Debian 10 Full Freeze Timing</h2>
<img alt="/images/freecadsplash.png" class="align-center" src="../../images/freecadsplash.png"><p><br></p>
<p>The official release date of FreeCAD 0.18
( <a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Release_notes_0.18">release notes</a> )
is March 12, 2019, although the git tag for it wasn't pushed until March 14th.
This timing was a bit unfortunate as the full freeze for Debian 10 went into
effect March 12th, with a de-facto freeze date of March 2nd due to the 10 day
testing migration period. To compound things, since this was my first Debian
release as a packaging contributor, I didn't do things quite right such that
while I probably could have gotten FreeCAD 0.18 into Debian 10, I didn't.
Instead, what's available is a pre-release version from about a month before
the release which is missing a few bugfixes and refinements.</p>
<p>On the positive side, this is an impetus for me to learn about <a class="reference external" href="https://backports.debian.org/">Debian
Backports</a>, a way to provide non-bugfix
updates to Debian Stable users. The 0.18 release line has already had several
bugfix releases; I've currently got Debian Testing/Unstable as well as the
Ubuntu Stable PPA up-to-date with version 0.18.3. As soon as I'm able, I'll get
this version into Debian Backports, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="freecad-ppa-improvements">
<h2>FreeCAD PPA Improvements</h2>
<p>Another nice improvement I've recently made is migrating the packaging for the
Ubuntu Stable and Daily PPAs to Debian's GitLab instance at
<a class="reference external" href="https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/freecad">https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/freecad</a> by creating the <tt class="docutils literal">ppa/master</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">ppa/daily</tt> branches. Having all the Debian and Ubuntu packaging in one place
means that propagating updates has become a matter of git merging and pushing.
Once any changes are in place, I simply have to trigger an import and build on
Launchpad for the stable releases. For the daily builds, changes are
automatically synced and the <tt class="docutils literal">debian</tt> directory from Salsa is combined with the
latest synced upstream source from GitHub, so daily builds no longer have to be
triggered manually. However, this has uncovered another problem in our process
which being worked on at the FreeCAD forums. (Thread: <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;t=37216">Finding a solution for
the 'version.h' issue</a></p>

<div class="section" id="science-team-package-updates">
<h2>Science Team Package Updates</h2>
<img alt="/images/bunny.png" class="align-center" src="../../images/bunny.png"><p><br></p>
<p>The main Science Team packages I've been working on recently have been
OpenCASCADE, Netgen, Gmsh, and OpenFOAM.</p>
<p>For OpenCASCADE, I have uploaded the third bugfix release in the 7.3.0 series.
Unfortunately, their versioning scheme is a bit unusual, so this version is tagged 7.3.0p3.
This is unfortunate because <tt class="docutils literal">dpkg <span class="pre">--compare-versions</span> 7.3.0p3+dfsg1 gt
7.3.0+dfsg1</tt> evaluates to false. As such, I've uploaded this package as 7.3.3,
with plans to contact upstream to discuss their bugfix release versioning
scheme. Currently, version 7.4.0 has an upstream target release date for the
end of August, so there will be an opportunity to convince them to release
7.4.1 instead of 7.4.0p1. If you're interested in the changes contained in this
upload, you can refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.dev.opencascade.org/gitweb/?p=occt.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/tags/V7_3_0p3">upstream git log</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Nico Schl√∂mer and Anton Gladky, the newest Gmsh, version
4.4.1, has been uploaded to wait in the Debian NEW queue. See <a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt">the upstream
changelog</a>
for more information on what's new.</p>
<p>I've also prepared the package for the newest version of Netgen, 6.2.1905.
Unfortunately, uploading this is blocked because 6.2.1810 is still in Debian
NEW. However, I've tested compiling FreeCAD against Netgen, and I've been able
to get the integration with it working again, so once I'm able to do this
upload, I'll be able to upload a new and improved FreeCAD with the power of
Netgen meshing.</p>
<p>I've also begun working on packaging the latest OpenFOAM release, 1906. I've
gotten a little sidetracked, though, as a pecularity in the way upstream
prepares their tarballs seems to be triggering a bug in GNU tar. I should have
this one uploaded soon. For a preview in what'll be coming, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.openfoam.com/releases/openfoam-v1906/">release
notes for version 1906</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="gitlab-ci-experimentation-with-salsa-debian-org">
<h2>GitLab CI Experimentation with salsa.debian.org</h2>
<p>Some incredibly awesome Debian contributors have set up the ability to use
GitLab CI to automate the testing of Debian packages (see <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa/Doc#Running_Continuous_Integration_.28CI.29_tests">documentation</a>.)</p>
<p>I did a bit of experimentation with it. Unfortunately, both OpenCASCADE and
FreeCAD exceeded the 2 hour time limit. There's a lot of promise in it for
smaller packages, though!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-2-removal-in-debian-underway">
<h2>Python 2 Removal in Debian Underway</h2>
<img alt="/images/deadsnakes.jpeg" class="align-center" src="../../images/deadsnakes.jpeg"><p><br></p>
<p>Per <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonclock.org">pythonclock.org</a>, Python 2 has less than 5
months until it's end-of-life, so the task of removing it for the next version
of Debian has begun. For now, it's mainly limited to leaf packages with nothing
depending on them. As such, I've uploaded Python 3-only packages for new
upstream releases of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python-fluids</span></tt> (a fluid dynamics engineering &amp; design
library) and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python-ulmo</span></tt> (provides clean &amp; simple access to public hydrology
and climatology data).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debian-developer-application">
<h2>Debian Developer Application</h2>
<p>I've finally applied to become a full Debian Developer, which is an exciting
prospect. I'll be more able to enact improvements without having to bug, well,
mostly Anton, Andreas, and Tobias. (Thanks!) I'm also looking forward to having
access to more resources to improve my packages on other architectures,
particularly arm64 now that the Raspberry Pi 4 is out and potentially a serious
candidate for a low-powered FreeCAD workstation.</p>
<p>The process is slow and calculating, as it should be, so it'll be some time
before I'm officially in, but it sure will be cause for celebration.</p>

<h2>Google Summer of Code Mentoring</h2>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="/images/gsoc.png" src="../../images/gsoc.png"><p class="caption">CC-BY-SA-4.0, Aswinshenoy.</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>I'm mentoring a Google Summer of Code project for FreeCAD this year! (See
<a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=35493">forum thread</a>.) My
student is quite new to FreeCAD and Debian/Ubuntu, so the first half of the
project has involved relatively the deep-end topics of using Debian packaging
to distribute bugfixes for FreeCAD and to learn by exploring related packages
in its ecosystem. In particular, focus was given to OpenCAMLib, since there is
a lot of user and developer interest in FreeCAD's potential for generating
toolpaths for machining and manufacturing the models created in the program.</p>
<p>Now that he's officially swimming and not sinking, the next phase is working on
making development and packaging-related improvements for FreeCAD on Windows,
which is in even rougher shape than Debian/Ubuntu, but more his area of
familiarity. Stay tuned for the final results!</p>
