Hello all! After reading some of the nice activity logs published by members of the
Debian Project at https://planet.debian.org, I've decided to publish my own version,
titled "Open Engineering Activities" since I plan on detailing things of a fairly
broad scope, beyond just my activity in the Debian or FreeCAD projects.

This summary will begin immediately where I left off with my last post summarizing
my FreeCAD GSoC work. Several packages are still in an intermediate stage, so there
is a bit of categorizing and updating work to be done just to 'clear my workspace'.

# Debian Science Team

- Gmsh 4 release
- Netgen 6.2.1807 release packaging
- Standalone SMESH packaging
- PySide 2 bugfixes
- Project Chrono
- OpenCAMLib and OpenVoronoi
- OpenFOAM updates

# FreeCAD Systems Administration

- planet freecad
- paying for VPS via Patreon
- FreeIPA installation
