as well. It's been a busy year: I've been studying machine design, robotics; partial differential
equations in general, and heat and mass transfer in particular. I've also been studying the source
code of FreeCAD. It has a great deal of potential application in things like unit operations and the
analysis of networks. For example, an irrigation network could be modeled geometrically and analyzed
for important overall properties of the system like the uniformity coefficient, which is a measure of
how pressure losses in the network and elevation changes affect how extreme a difference exists between
the relatively "wettest" and "driest" outputs. I did some early modeling of this using Python in&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>freecad</category><guid>/blog/my-freecad-project-was-accepted-into-google-summer-of-code/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2017 07:41:23 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
