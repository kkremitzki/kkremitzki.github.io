<p>Hello all! After reading some of the nice activity logs published by members of the
Debian Project at <a class="reference external" href="https://planet.debian.org">https://planet.debian.org</a>, I've decided to publish my own version.
This will mostly be my work on FreeCAD and Debian, but will also include other points
of note from my many interests. I'll also include relevant activities for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.patreon.com/kkremitzki">my supporters
on Patreon</a></p>
<p>As covered in my previous post, most of the first half of August was spent finishing
my Google Summer of Code project for FreeCAD, which largely turned into "packaging
for the Debian Science Team" since FreeCAD's dependency chain and options for
integration are so vast. However, the nature of the work is highly parallel.
For example, when packaging, most issues occur either almost immediately into the build,
or after the build has finished. This means that after an initial bit of packaging work
that allows a build to actually proceed, one then has to launch the build and wait
anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to see the next issue arise. So, as a
result, I worked on <em>many</em> packages in parallel. A negative consequence of this was
that I somewhat overloaded my plate in terms of things I can handle, so in actuality
this meant I would work on a handful of packages on several machines at once, and then
once those issues were largely resolved I would move onto another handful, rather
than really juggling them all at once.</p>
<p>After finishing GSoC, I first turned my attention to two of the packages I had
worked on in parallel, python-fluids and python-ulmo.</p>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/python-fluids">python-fluids</a></h2>
<p>I made a new upload for this package to correct several issues. Here's an excerpt from the changelog:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
* [1215102] Make python-fluids-doc Multi-Arch: foreign
* [eb610fd] Correct Vcs-* fields
* [62570cd] Updated to Standards-Version 4.2.0, no change required
* [29e96a7] Correct debian/watch
* [3e90d05] Add missing scipy dependency
* [cd776a2] Add lintian override for
  package-contains-documentation-outside-usr-share-doc
</pre>
<p>The package still fails some reproducibility tests on i386 and could use a standards version bump, but other
than that, this package is almost completely clean now! It's quite satisfying cleaning up these packages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/python-ulmo">python-ulmo</a></h2>
<p>I made an upload for this package as well:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
* [7150daa] Correct Vcs-* fields
* [027b50b] Mark python-ulmo-doc as Multi-Arch: foreign
* [d72b6f6] Add patch to fix FutureWarning
</pre>
<p>The package was failing its autopkgtests because Python was emitting a FutureWarning onto stderr.
This package is actually fully reproducible, and only needs a standards version bump to be fully clean.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gmsh">gmsh</a></h2>
<p>On August 22nd, <a class="reference external" href="http://gmsh.info/">Gmsh 4.0.0 was released!</a> The Java API was removed and a Julia one added.
This is a nice release because in
<a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=904946">Debian bug #904946</a> it was found that the Gmsh package, after being updated to
be built against OCCT instead of OCE, actually no longer worked when used in FreeCAD, giving the error:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Error   : Gmsh requires OpenCASCADE to import shape
</pre>
<p>My hope was that by updating to the new Gmsh version, this problem would resolve itself. However, I ran into a few problems and had to postpone
finishing up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id4">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/netgen">netgen</a></h2>
<p>On August 19th, <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=906619">Debian bug #906619</a> was reported against Netgen, which was
an occasion to look at the state of the package. I noticed that upstream had released version 6.2.1807 (versus the current .1804) but
it was not tagged in the Netgen repository, only as a submodule of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ngsolve/ngsolve">Ngsolve repository</a>.</p>
<p>On August 31st, I packaged the new version and resolved the bug
in <a class="reference external" href="https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/netgen/merge_requests/9/commits">science-team/netgen PR #9</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="salome-smesh">
<h2>salome-smesh</h2>
<p>Although technically not August, on September 3rd I pushed the <a class="reference external" href="https://salsa.debian.org/kkremitzki-guest/salome-smesh">nearly finished package for a standalone salome-smesh on Salsa</a>
which is fully functional except for an issue with the CMake config file. I submitted a pull request to support multi-arch for the package
but forgot to update the path in the CMake config file, so the variables therein have to be manually set, or the file edited.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cantera">
<h2>cantera</h2>
<p>On August 24th, Cantera 2.4.0 was released:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Cantera is an open-source suite of tools for problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes.
</pre>
<p>Previously there had been an issue with the build, where the packages would be made successfully, but attempting to <cite>import cantera</cite> in
Python would error out, presumably due to the way an included copy of libfmt was handled during the build. However, the issue is no longer
present, so I now have a working Cantera 2.4.0 package! The only shortcoming is that I don't have working docs build yet, so this package
didn't make it in time for August.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/openfoam">openfoam</a></h2>
<p>Previously I had submitted a pull request for OpenFOAM 6 to the Debian Science Team, but spontaneously the package began to fail,
presumably due to some change in a dependency. I spent some time troubleshooting this issue but haven't found a resolution yet.
Here's a snippet of the build failure:</p>

<p>I'll have to continue investigating this one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id6">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/pyside2">pyside2</a></h2>
<p>I reported <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=906020">Debian bug #906020</a> about missing Python 3 CMake config files,
which was fixed Aug 28th. I began investigating how this would Pivy builds, but got sidetracked by a problem with the <cite>med-fichier</cite> package.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id7">

</pre>
<p>There are several instances of this throughout the codebase that can basically be fixed with by adding some <cite>#include</cite> s.</p>

<div class="section" id="projectchrono">
<h2>projectchrono</h2>
<p>There was a bit of discussion about utilization of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.projectchrono.org/">Project Chrono</a>, an open source multi-physics simulation engine,
in FreeCAD. One problem with pursuing this is that it isn't packaged at all for Debian, which is rather surprising! It seems like high-quality software.
I began looking at packaging it and it actually doesn't seem that bad. One of the main issues is actually the naming: it's really long! There's also a
bit of worry about naming collisions I'll have to look into. As of now, I have a working package except for the Python bindings. Enabling them results
in this failure in the build process:</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/med-fichier">med-fichier package</a> in Debian currently is built with autotools but somewhat supports CMake builds, which
would be nice to switch to as it would provide CMake configuration files in libmedc-dev. I worked on updating the package, but currently building docs is broken,
and for some reason, the Fortran library is being statically linked.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/planet-venus">planet-venus package</a> in Debian is available for running your own RSS feed aggregation service.
I wanted to set up a planet.freecad.io to provide exactly that. However, the current version of the package is broken, and it only works in Debian 7, a.k.a. old-old-stable.</p>
<p>I spent some time researching the state of the package, but it's fairly rough, and most importantly, upstream is far from active. I'd like to run the RSS service but
fixing the package seems like a tall order.</p>

<p>Hello all! This post is my final work product for GSoC 2018 for the FreeCAD project.
The main center for communication for FreeCAD is the forums, but we also coordinated things
through the #freecad channel on Freenode.
<a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=28478">The main thread for my project was here.</a></p>
<p>To summarize my project: FreeCAD is a complex application with an extensive dependency tree. The packaging
situation has always trailed the tip of development, which means users don't get to see the best FreeCAD
has to offer, and people trying to help new users have to deal with sometimes years-old bugs.
The goal was to improve the general ecosystem of the FreeCAD stack, and to cut down on technical debt to
make things easier moving forward. After some consideration it was decided to focus on Debian packaging
since that would be the most 'ecologically good'.</p>
<p>I began with a rough knowledge of Debian packaging, but now feel competent
enough to want to take over the maintenance of Debian packaging for FreeCAD and several other packages
within the Debian Science Team, which will improve the free software engineering experience in Debian
as well as its derivatives such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint. In fact, I plan on trying to offically become
a Debian Maintainer and then Debian Developer. On the 4th of July during the middle of the project
I drove to Houston for a GPG keysigning, so the wheels are already in motion.</p>
<p>This post will summarize my work throughout the summer chronologically, mostly linking to emails in
the Debian Science mailing list, pull requests on Debian's Gitlab instance or Github, and to some repositories.</p>

<p>Now that GSoC is done I am excited to continue working within the Debian Science Team. Besides an upcoming FreeCAD 0.18 release,
I have several packages I plan to make improvements to and to package for Debian, and ultimately to integrate into future
FreeCAD workbenches as part of my plan to make it the ultimate 3D engineering toolbox!</p>
<p>Therefore, I must say thanks to the FreeCAD and Debian communities for working with me, and to my GSoC mentors and GSoC itself
for providing me this wonderful opportunity. May it continue providing valuable opportunities for others for many years to come.</p>

<p>2017 has been an incredible year for me with lots of opportunities, but many
challenges as well. In the spring, I got a (lab) teaching opportunity for a
50-student Measurement &amp; Control of Biological Systems course, culminating in
17 teams making maze-solving autonomous robots. There's a higher level of
mastery to be attained by teaching others, and in that regard, it was an
incredible experience. Teaching, however, is well outside my comfort zone, and
in that regard it had some difficulties.</p>
<p>In the summer, I was able to work on a Google Summer of Code project/pseudo-internship.
Working in a mix of Python and C++ was again an interesting challenge since
I'm much more familiar with the former than the latter, and even my experience
with other languages lies on the Python side of the interpreted/compiled,
dynamic/static typing divide. Still, it was an invaluable experience since C++
rules the domain of finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics,
which I want to explore further. Particularly, FreeCAD is the perfect vehicle for
engineering computer modeling, so I have high hopes for my future with the project.</p>
<p>At the end of the summer, I passed the exam for the Linux Foundation Certified
System Administrator. This was an opportunity provided by a scholarship given
in part because of my work using Python to analyze the efficiency of backyard
irrigation systems in the Yucatán back in early 2016, so it was great to finally
see the culmination of that work. As a little celebration project, I decided to
begin running my own Linux mail server, which has been a great success. There
were a few hiccups with blacklists on Yahoo and Outlook, but I was ultimately
able to get it working with all the major email providers.</p>
<p>I also embarked on a project I've been wanting to do for a long time: running
my own Linux router. I found a great series of tutorials on setting up such a
router using Ubuntu and the Pine64 board, and have had excellent results since.</p>
<p>I have also been spending time here and there researching a really promising
project, FreeIPA. It's a sort of competitor to Active Directory in the identity
management space, mostly made up of a combination of an LDAP, Kerberos, and
certificate server. I'm running a sort of pseudo-small business in my home
network using my FreeIPA server as a centralized authentication, authorization,
and identity server, and it's been a great experience so far; I hope to apply it
in reality with the FreeCAD project one day. Look out for future posts on the
topic.</p>
<p>In the fall, I began my final year at Texas A&amp;M. My capstone project and team
was assigned. Our project involves analyzing the flood resiliency of the Houston
area and proposing an ecological engineering design to improve that resiliency and
mitigate the effects of future extreme flood events such as was seen during
Hurricane Harvey. We are using an open-source toolchain involving PostGIS, Python,
and QGIS, and the project is really quite exciting since our analysis could be applied
to other coastal cities and regions facing extreme weather events in the future.</p>
<p>Altogether, it's been a great year, but I foresee 2018 being even better. If
you're reading this, I want to wish you a happy new year with hope for the same!</p>

<p>Well, it's time to finally wrap up the summer!</p>
<p>It's been a really great and rewarding opportunity, so I first want to thank everyone at Google and beyond who helped put GSoC together,
as well as my mentor Stefan Tröger for providing feedback and guidance.</p>
<p>I was able to work with code that ranged almost the entire stack of FreeCAD dependencies: from low-level OpenCASCADE code involving
quaternions &amp; transformations, geometry &amp; topology; to the scene graph library Coin3D we have to thank for our pretty screenshots;
the connection between C++ and Python code, which I have a feeling will be useful later in my engineering career; and all the way up to the
Qt GUI in both C++ as well as its Python interface PySide.</p>
<p>As a result, I feel very prepared to continue working with the FreeCAD project and look forward to doing so. I really think it's a great
program and hope to use it for many years in the future.</p>
<p>So again, my thanks!</p>
<p>The main goal of the project was to get test coverage of the Part Design Workbench, and to explore it to find showstopping bugs. The only
remaining one involves a crash in ShapeBinder, discussed at <a class="reference external" href="https://freecadweb.org/tracker/view.php?id=2517">https://freecadweb.org/tracker/view.php?id=2517</a>.</p>
<p>I fixed quite a few bugs and I think the general experience with the workbench is better.
Test coverage is there for all the tools, and I'd say the workbench is ready for the public, so now the major work is to release FreeCAD 0.17,
the biggest FreeCAD release ever, with its new Part Design (no longer "NEXT") Workbench.</p>
<p>My other goal of improvements to Boolean Operation was made unnecessary by someone else's PR in May.</p>
<p>The last goal, improvements to the Attachment Editor, ended up being a little too big for this GSoC, and could even possibly serve
as a good GSoC project for next summer, although whoever does it had better be fairly artistic at making explanatory yet small icons.</p>
<p>In my opinion, I'd say the summer was a success.</p>
<p>Altogether, my code contribution can be summarized with 7 PRs and one experimental branch:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it looks like solid, usable improvements to the Attachment Editor are unlikely to be ready for a PR
by the end of my GSoC, although I will publish my experimental branch which uses Python for the datum tools and uses the Python-based
Attachment Editor I mentioned previously.</p>
<p>However, as a consolation I did finalize some additional tests for PartDesign Hole, so my goal of functional coverage of the PartDesign tools
succeeded.</p>
<p>Also, I think with this foray into GUI code, I've hit nearly the full stack of libraries used in FreeCAD this summer. It feels pretty nice, because
I feel prepared to tackle whatever problem I want to in the FreeCAD project.</p>

<p>The final portion of GSoC for me will be dedicated to working on improvements to the Attachment Editor, and this post will essentially be my design
for what those improvements will look like. The Attachment Editor is available in the Part Workbench through Python. One can for example create a simple
Part Cube, select it, then click Part -&gt; Attachment. It also is used when creating datum geometry in Part Design, or when creating a primitive.</p>
<p>Here are a few screenshots:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="command palette" src="../images/gsoc-10-1.png"><p class="caption">Figure 1. The Python-based Attachment Editor in the Part workbench.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="command palette" src="../images/gsoc-10-2.png"><p class="caption">Figure 2. Creating a Datum Plane.</p>
</div>
<p>Creating datum geometry is a key part of the Part Design process, so it's helpful for it to be very easy and intuitive. The current
Attachment Mode information especially can be quite overwhelming to a beginner, however. Especially considering how improvements
to the Attachment Editor could be reused in a future Assembly Workbench, it was decided to look into improving these tools.</p>
<p>The first, most obvious improvement here would be inactivating the "Extra placement" section when inactive. This could
possibly be accomplished by making a separate collapsible section which automatically hides when there is no attachment.</p>
<p>The second, and tougher improvement, involves reworking the current the four attachment selections and the attachment mode.
Reference names probably don't need to be more than 3/4ths the width of the page. The methods for selecting references via
an activation button, and deleting via clearing out the text are not user-friendly.</p>
<p>The four-reference list here would ideally be replaced with an icon-based grid, which starts out empty. Each selection's icon would
be based on its type, e.g. Vertex, Edge, Face, Curve, etc., where available, and a generic icon for unrecognized types. The selection's name
could be displayed in a shortened form, e.g. "MyLongShapeNameIs...". This approach could be extended for future Assembly use by adding a scrollbar
on the icons, allowing for several rows of attachment references, 4 at a time.</p>
<p>This tool could be very user-friendly, as invalid reference icons can be highlighted red, and when the attachment is complete, the reference set's icons
can be highlighted green. Ghosted icons can be displayed as needed for a selected Attachment Mode.</p>
<p>A similar approach for Attachment Mode could be used. Using a 4-icon row with a scrollbar, attachment modes can be explained with a short label and
an icon, where feasible; hopefully the large size will allow for expressive icons. When a mode is moused over or selected, the remaining references required
can be displayed in the reference selection area.</p>
<p>Altogether, (i) splitting out the placement and toggling when it has no effect (i.e. there is no attachment) and (ii) reworking Reference Selection and Attachment Mode
dialogs to use unified icon list GUI code, as well as (iii) making the icon set to explain the attachment concepts to users, comprise the components of this
"Attachment Editor Improvement" project.</p>

<p>I celebrated my birthday in south Texas last week! I was about 3 miles from the future SpaceX launch facility opening in 2018.
It'll be great to possibly see launches to Mars from there in the next few years.</p>
<p>I mostly spent this week working on the bugs I mentioned last week. I wanted to try to make a dent in the outstanding bugs I've found.
Unfortunately, my lack of C++ background (compared to Python) really hampered this; it's a little bit like trying to run before you walk.
In the end, I only fixed the Revolution bug(s). In the case where a revolution is attempted on the same plane as the sketch, resulting in e.g. a flat disc,
the issue was that the code was checking the angle between the sketch's normal and the revolution plane's normal, looking for a 0° angle. However,
it was failing to fail in the case of a 180° angle.</p>
<p>I also added a simple convenience check for all tools in Part Design: if you open a document with only one body and try to click a PDN tool's button,
the single body will be auto-activated instead of popping up a warning. If there are no bodies or more than one, the warning still occurs.</p>

<p>Total tool coverage lasted less than a week! It's a good thing though, because that means a new tool <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/898">landed in master</a>: PartDesign Hole.</p>
<object class="align-center" data="../images/PartDesign_Hole.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
Part Design Hole tool</object>
<p>This is a really great tool for the Part Design WB not only because holes (and their corresponding fasteners) are ubiquitous in part design generally,
but also because the tool does a good job of capturing that information into a FreeCAD object that can be later be hooked into for both the
Assembly and TechDraw workbenches. For example, the options I've selected in the following screenshot could be used to complete a technical drawing
for this part in FreeCAD, and that information exchange could be done in an automated and customizable way.</p>
<img alt="Part Design Hole tool" class="align-center" src="../images/gsoc-8-1.png"><p>This information could also be used by the Path WB to generate control code for open-source, automated manufacturing processes and machines, so it's really
great to have such a full-featured tool added.</p>
<p>I spent some time trying to find bugs in the tool, but didn't really find any. The only gotcha I noticed is related to the orientation of sketches which serve as the
basis for holes. There is no Reverse option for the Hole feature itself, so for example, if you have a sketch on the "bottom" of an object but not attached to it,
you may need to set the Map Reversed option for the sketch itself to true.</p>
<p>Some tests will be forthcoming for Hole, but besides that, I also spent some time looking at few outstanding bugs in C++-land.</p>
<p>Particularly,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(mentioned in week 5) ShapeBinder crash when base object not initially selected due to null pointer dereference</li>
<li>(mentioned in week 3) Revolution has unhandled error for some bad revolution axis choices, does bad revolution without error for others</li>
<li>(new) Pipe fails when its path is a loop. For example, a Pipe with a circle as a base and a larger, orthogonal circle passing through the base should become a torus.
Currently, it fails with the wonderfully verbose error message 'TopoDS::Shell'.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hit a nice milestone this week! With <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/899">PR 899</a> I hit total tool <em>test</em> coverage for the Part Design workbench.
Now, what exactly does that mean? Well, if you look at my screenshot of the workbench tools from Week 2, every one of those is now covered by tests with most
key functionality hit. Some of them, like the dressup features Fillet and Chamfer, only have one test, either because the tool is simple or because further tests
lie outside the scope of the Part Design workbench (e.g. testing the topological naming robustness of Fillet to recalculation.)</p>
<p>The PartDesign Primitive (Box, Cylinder, Sphere, Cone, Ellipsoid, Torus, Prism, and Wedge) tests were interesting to write.
I was able to cover basic construction of both Additive and Subtractive primitives of each type by simply making a large Additive Primitive
and smaller Subtractive Primitive inside the first, and then ensuring that the ensuing Shape's Volume property was about equal to
the difference in volumes according to the formula for that shape, e.g.</p>
<p>\[
\mathrm{Shape.Volume}\ \approx V = \frac{4}{3}\pi (R^3 - r^3)
\]</p>
<p>for Additive-<span class="math">\(R\)</span> and Subtractive-<span class="math">\(r\)</span> Primitive Spheres.
I had to look up a few volume formulas but otherwise the tests for the lengthly list in the parentheses above went quickly.</p>
<p>I also fixed a bug with Loft sections not being hidden, so e.g. the Sketches being lofted to or through were still visible.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was an issue with both Loft and Pipe not claiming children correctly in the tree which I fixed.</p>

<p>Short post this week! I was in Spokane, Washington, from July 15-19th for a robotics competition being held at the Annual International Meeting of my professional society,
the American Society of Agricultural &amp; Biological Engineers, or ASABE. I only had a smattering of time to work on the various FreeCAD bugs I have mentioned in previous posts
so there isn't much to report on that front. Instead, I'll leave a picture from the beautiful Spokane downtown area.</p>
