- Web infrastructure like virtual hosting, networking and hardware performance
- Take a picture of the V-notch weir south of golf course and do some analysis on it
- Talk about Python engineering libraries, e.g. for thermodynamics
- Talk about Python math stuff, e.g. graph theory basics
- Talk about ecosystem modeling stuff, e.g. Lotka-Volterra, Lorenz attractor
- Meta-post about stuff like Nikola, Taskwarrior & workflows
- Post investigating open-source project management software
- Talk about open-source engineering software, like CAD stuff, Octave, QGis
    - 2D CAD: DraftSight, made by Dassault Syst√®mes, makers of SolidWorks.
    - 3D Cad: FreeCAD - powerful 3D parametric modeler, but hard to compete with sheer amount of engineering effort put into SolidWorks - inertia is big factor keeping it down
        - SolidWorks is not really an option for about 98% of the populace. So comparing feature sets to that isn't really a reason for anything.
        - SolidWorks is an option for
            - Millionaires
            - Mechanical engineers who use it for work
- Open-source productivity software like LibreOffice
- Merits/philosophies of open source, open source communities 
  (making something that is a resource for humanity rather than almost parasitic nature of companies like Microsoft)
- Cool/exotic applications of Linux like pipe bending software, space, drones, SDR, guitar, etc
- NumPy for numerical analysis
- Finite element method tools:
  - Elmer includes physical models of fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, heat transfer and acoustics, for example. These are described by partial differential equations which Elmer solves by the Finite Element Method (FEM).
