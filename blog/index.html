<p>Hello, and welcome to my "summer update" on my free software work on FreeCAD
and the Debian Science team. I call it a summer update because it was winter
when I last wrote, and quite some time has elapsed since I fell out of the
monthly update habit. This is a high-level summary of what I've been working on
since March.</p>
<div class="section" id="freecad-0-18-release-debian-10-full-freeze-timing">
<h2>FreeCAD 0.18 Release &amp; Debian 10 Full Freeze Timing</h2>
<img alt="/images/freecadsplash.png" class="align-center" src="../images/freecadsplash.png"><p><br></p>
<p>The official release date of FreeCAD 0.18
( <a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Release_notes_0.18">release notes</a> )
is March 12, 2019, although the git tag for it wasn't pushed until March 14th.
This timing was a bit unfortunate as the full freeze for Debian 10 went into
effect March 12th, with a de-facto freeze date of March 2nd due to the 10 day
testing migration period. To compound things, since this was my first Debian
release as a packaging contributor, I didn't do things quite right such that
while I probably could have gotten FreeCAD 0.18 into Debian 10, I didn't.
Instead, what's available is a pre-release version from about a month before
the release which is missing a few bugfixes and refinements.</p>
<p>On the positive side, this is an impetus for me to learn about <a class="reference external" href="https://backports.debian.org/">Debian
Backports</a>, a way to provide non-bugfix
updates to Debian Stable users. The 0.18 release line has already had several
bugfix releases; I've currently got Debian Testing/Unstable as well as the
Ubuntu Stable PPA up-to-date with version 0.18.3. As soon as I'm able, I'll get
this version into Debian Backports, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="freecad-ppa-improvements">
<h2>FreeCAD PPA Improvements</h2>
<p>Another nice improvement I've recently made is migrating the packaging for the
Ubuntu Stable and Daily PPAs to Debian's GitLab instance at
<a class="reference external" href="https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/freecad">https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/freecad</a> by creating the <tt class="docutils literal">ppa/master</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">ppa/daily</tt> branches. Having all the Debian and Ubuntu packaging in one place
means that propagating updates has become a matter of git merging and pushing.
Once any changes are in place, I simply have to trigger an import and build on
Launchpad for the stable releases. For the daily builds, changes are
automatically synced and the <tt class="docutils literal">debian</tt> directory from Salsa is combined with the
latest synced upstream source from GitHub, so daily builds no longer have to be
triggered manually. However, this has uncovered another problem in our process
which being worked on at the FreeCAD forums. (Thread: <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;t=37216">Finding a solution for
the 'version.h' issue</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="science-team-package-updates">
<h2>Science Team Package Updates</h2>
<img alt="/images/bunny.png" class="align-center" src="../images/bunny.png"><p><br></p>
<p>The main Science Team packages I've been working on recently have been
OpenCASCADE, Netgen, Gmsh, and OpenFOAM.</p>
<p>For OpenCASCADE, I have uploaded the third bugfix release in the 7.3.0 series.
Unfortunately, their versioning scheme is a bit unusual, so this version is tagged 7.3.0p3.
This is unfortunate because <tt class="docutils literal">dpkg <span class="pre">--compare-versions</span> 7.3.0p3+dfsg1 gt
7.3.0+dfsg1</tt> evaluates to false. As such, I've uploaded this package as 7.3.3,
with plans to contact upstream to discuss their bugfix release versioning
scheme. Currently, version 7.4.0 has an upstream target release date for the
end of August, so there will be an opportunity to convince them to release
7.4.1 instead of 7.4.0p1. If you're interested in the changes contained in this
upload, you can refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.dev.opencascade.org/gitweb/?p=occt.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/tags/V7_3_0p3">upstream git log</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Nico Schl√∂mer and Anton Gladky, the newest Gmsh, version
4.4.1, has been uploaded to wait in the Debian NEW queue. See <a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt">the upstream
changelog</a>
for more information on what's new.</p>
<p>I've also prepared the package for the newest version of Netgen, 6.2.1905.
Unfortunately, uploading this is blocked because 6.2.1810 is still in Debian
NEW. However, I've tested compiling FreeCAD against Netgen, and I've been able
to get the integration with it working again, so once I'm able to do this
upload, I'll be able to upload a new and improved FreeCAD with the power of
Netgen meshing.</p>
<p>I've also begun working on packaging the latest OpenFOAM release, 1906. I've
gotten a little sidetracked, though, as a pecularity in the way upstream
prepares their tarballs seems to be triggering a bug in GNU tar. I should have
this one uploaded soon. For a preview in what'll be coming, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.openfoam.com/releases/openfoam-v1906/">release
notes for version 1906</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gitlab-ci-experimentation-with-salsa-debian-org">
<h2>GitLab CI Experimentation with salsa.debian.org</h2>
<p>Some incredibly awesome Debian contributors have set up the ability to use
GitLab CI to automate the testing of Debian packages (see <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa/Doc#Running_Continuous_Integration_.28CI.29_tests">documentation</a>.)</p>
<p>I did a bit of experimentation with it. Unfortunately, both OpenCASCADE and
FreeCAD exceeded the 2 hour time limit. There's a lot of promise in it for
smaller packages, though!</p>

<div class="section" id="python-2-removal-in-debian-underway">
<h2>Python 2 Removal in Debian Underway</h2>
<img alt="/images/deadsnakes.jpeg" class="align-center" src="../images/deadsnakes.jpeg"><p><br></p>
<p>Per <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonclock.org">pythonclock.org</a>, Python 2 has less than 5
months until it's end-of-life, so the task of removing it for the next version
of Debian has begun. For now, it's mainly limited to leaf packages with nothing
depending on them. As such, I've uploaded Python 3-only packages for new
upstream releases of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python-fluids</span></tt> (a fluid dynamics engineering &amp; design
library) and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python-ulmo</span></tt> (provides clean &amp; simple access to public hydrology
and climatology data).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debian-developer-application">
<h2>Debian Developer Application</h2>
<p>I've finally applied to become a full Debian Developer, which is an exciting
prospect. I'll be more able to enact improvements without having to bug, well,
mostly Anton, Andreas, and Tobias. (Thanks!) I'm also looking forward to having
access to more resources to improve my packages on other architectures,
particularly arm64 now that the Raspberry Pi 4 is out and potentially a serious
candidate for a low-powered FreeCAD workstation.</p>
<p>The process is slow and calculating, as it should be, so it'll be some time
before I'm officially in, but it sure will be cause for celebration.</p>

<h2>Google Summer of Code Mentoring</h2>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="/images/gsoc.png" src="../images/gsoc.png"><p class="caption">CC-BY-SA-4.0, Aswinshenoy.</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>I'm mentoring a Google Summer of Code project for FreeCAD this year! (See
<a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=35493">forum thread</a>.) My
student is quite new to FreeCAD and Debian/Ubuntu, so the first half of the
project has involved relatively the deep-end topics of using Debian packaging
to distribute bugfixes for FreeCAD and to learn by exploring related packages
in its ecosystem. In particular, focus was given to OpenCAMLib, since there is
a lot of user and developer interest in FreeCAD's potential for generating
toolpaths for machining and manufacturing the models created in the program.</p>
<p>Now that he's officially swimming and not sinking, the next phase is working on
making development and packaging-related improvements for FreeCAD on Windows,
which is in even rougher shape than Debian/Ubuntu, but more his area of
familiarity. Stay tuned for the final results!</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Hello all and welcome again to another of my monthly summary posts on my work
in free software, with a focus on open engineering in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> &amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.  I'm
fortunate to have the <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2019/02/msg00008.html">February 12th Debian 10 soft freeze deadline</a> to
scapegoat for my missed January update, and thanks too to February for being
short enough to postpone it further and combine the two updates.</p>
<p>I've decided to go with a bit of a dryer chronological approach to this update
as there's lots to cover. Worth highlighting, however:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="highlights">
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>New Debian upload for a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a> 0.18 pre-release</li>
<li>New Debian upload for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.openfoam.com/">OpenFOAM</a>. An upstream
switch from openfoam.org to openfoam.com and a different versioning scheme
results in a massive version bump, 4.1 to 1812. That's over 1800 versions better.
(Seriously though, it's about a 2 year bump in changes.)</li>
<li>New Debian uploads for <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_generation">mesh generation</a> softwares <a class="reference external" href="http://gmsh.info/">Gmsh</a> 4.1.3 and <a class="reference external" href="https://ngsolve.org/">Netgen</a> 6.2.1810 --
though Netgen might miss Debian 10? It's stuck in the NEW queue.</li>

student to mentor</li>

everyone's first encounter with FreeCAD is with the latest and greatest

<p>Hello again for another of my monthly updates on my work on Debian Science and
the FreeCAD ecosystem.</p>
<p>There's only a few announcement items since I was mostly enjoying my holidays,
but several important things were accomplished this month. Also, since there's
not much time left before the release of Debian 10, there's some consideration
to be done towards what I'll be working on in the next few months.</p>
<div class="section" id="gmsh-bugfix-no-gmsh-4-yet">
<h2>gmsh bugfix; no gmsh 4 yet</h2>
<img alt="/images/dec18-gmsh.png" class="align-center" src="../images/dec18-gmsh.png"><p>At the beginning of the month, I uploaded gmsh 3.0.6+dfsg1-4. This had a patch
submitted by Joost van Zwieten (thanks!) to fix <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=904946">Debian bug #904946</a> which was
preventing gmsh usage in FreeCAD, as well as adding an autopkgtest to make sure
that behavior remains.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-coin3d-transition-pivy-uploaded">
<h2>New Coin3D transition; Pivy uploaded!</h2>
<img alt="/images/dec18-coin3d.jpeg" class="align-center" src="../images/dec18-coin3d.jpeg"><p>Near the middle of the month, Leo Palomo-Avellaneda, Anton Gladky, and I finished the
transition for the coin3 package, which is a scene graph library and high-level
wrapper of OpenGL. The new version is a pre-release coin3 4.0.0 which adds
CMake support. It also fixes <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=874727">Debian bug #874727</a> which caused
FreeCAD to segfault when importing an SVG.  FreeCAD also uses pivy, a Python
wrapper for coin, as a runtime dependency, and completing this transition has
finished the last blocker for a Python 3 FreeCAD package, so thanks to Leo and
Anton!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-release-for-med-fichier-not-by-me">
<h2>New release for med-fichier (not by me)</h2>
<object class="align-center" data="../images/dec18-HDF.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
/images/dec18-HDF.svg</object>
<p>Another FreeCAD dependency had a new release this month, <a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/med-fichier">med-fichier 4.0.0</a>.  This software is developed by
√âlectricit√© de France and built on the HDF5 library and file format but is
specialized for mesh data. It is also a dependency of gmsh which introduced
some difficulty for the gmsh package.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="openfoam-upstream-switch-from-openfoam-org-to-openfoam-com">
<h2>OpenFOAM upstream switch; from openfoam.org to openfoam.com</h2>
<img alt="/images/dec18-openfoam.jpg" class="align-center" src="../images/dec18-openfoam.jpg"><p>The final noteworthy item for this month was an interesting bit of
correspondence I received concerning the OpenFOAM package. As I had mentioned
in previous posts, the current OpenFOAM version in Debian is 4.x, and I had
worked on updating the package for OpenFOAM 6.x. My packaging was working and
complete last summer, but for an inexplicable reason it stopped building late
summer, started building again for about a week in September, and then stopped
again. I would really like an up-to-date OpenFOAM in Debian 10, and so when I
received an email from the people at openfoam.com about packaging their
version, I was very intrigued. You see, the version in Debian is currently from
openfoam.org. Besides the TLD difference, there is a bit of history between the
two versions, but for end users there should major difference. If you're
interested in more background, you can consult <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ggYvqEwghQ">this video by J√≥zsef Nagy</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, it seems likely that the OpenFOAM package will be changing over to
the openfoam.com version soon. I've already succesfully built the latest
OpenFOAM from this source, version 1812, and plan to submit it soon.</p>

<div class="section" id="intro">
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Welcome to another of my monthly summaries on my work in the free software
world. My mission is to make engineering and science available for everyone,
and Debian, the Universal Operating System, is my weapon of choice.</p>
<p>I received some feedback on my last post that I made it seem I would be
stepping away from my role maintaining FreeCAD and other packages on the Debian
Science Team, which was an unfortunate miscommunication on my part. Mainly, I
just would like to reduce the proportion of my overall free software time on
it, from its current amount, nearly 100%, to a roughly even 1/3rd split between
Debian Science, FreeCAD, and PostCAD. The latter is a promising personal
project to make an OpenCASCADE-powered CAD extension for PostgreSQL, bringing
support for CAD file formats, datatypes, and algorithms to the powerful
Postgres ecosystem, similar to what PostCAD has done for geospatial analysis.
This could serve as a backend for both FreeCAD in the short term, and in the
long term, it could power a web-based version of FreeCAD, perhaps with some
Django-powered middleware serving a REST API for some WebGL-based frontend.</p>
<p>So, besides summarizing my work this month, I also plan to give a synopsis on
my Debian packaging, for both what's in-progress and on my wishlist. As you'll
see, it's quite extensive. My hope is that by whittling away at both lists, my
Debian Science work can focus more on maintenance of existing packages, and
free up some time for other things.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sponsors">
<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<p>My work on Debian Science, FreeCAD, and PostCAD is <cite>supported by my patrons on
Patreon &lt;https://patreon.com/kkremitzki&gt;</cite>. While I had created a Liberapay a
while back, I never got any traction with it, and I found out recently that it
was because I had not set it up to actually receive payments. So, if you don't
like Patreon for whatever reason, you can also <a class="reference external" href="https://liberapay.com/kkremitzki">support me on Liberapay</a>. Just to round things out, if you don't
like either of those platforms, you can also <a class="reference external" href="https://paypal.me/kkremitzki">help support my work via PayPal</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transition-for-coin3">
<h2>Transition for coin3</h2>
<p>Coin3D is a scene graph library and a fundamental part of FreeCAD.
Unfortunately, it hasn't had a release since 2011, but development has been
picking up recently, so it's likely that a release is not too far off. Even
without a formal release, several improvements have been made including CMake
support, so it's time to prepare a transition in advance of the Debian 10
release. Luckily, Leo Palomo-Avellaneda has taken the initiative of getting
this transition started.</p>
<p>Currently, the new Coin3D package is available in Debian Experimental as we
prepare the reverse-dependencies to build against it. For FreeCAD, we directly
depend on Pivy, which are Python bindings for Coin. Pivy, in turn, depends on
Coin and SoQt, which is a Qt GUI component toolkit library for Coin. A
pre-release version of SoQt is also being packaged since, like Coin, CMake
support has been added, as well as support for Qt 5.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've been grinding my gears on building Pivy against the new
Coin and SoQt for a good part of this month, which is especially troublesome
since FreeCAD's transition to Python 3 is blocked by the upload of a new Pivy,
which I prepared earlier this year.</p>
<p>With any luck, I'll be able to help Leo finish the Coin and SoQt transition and
have Pivy prepared in December.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gmsh-update">
<h2>Gmsh Update</h2>
<p>Gmsh is a 3D finite element mesh generator with built-in pre- and
post-processing facilities. It's also one of the main meshers used by FreeCAD's
Finite Element Modeling Workbench, besides Netgen.</p>
<p>Currently Debian has Gmsh 3.0.6, but a new major version was released in
August. I've already prepared this new major version for testing in FreeCAD's
Community Extras PPA, but I hadn't cleaned up the packaging yet to submit to
Debian. However, in November, there were two point releases, 4.0.5 and 4.0.6,
so I wasn't able to complete this work this month, but I'm sure it'll be done
in early December.</p>
<p>One major piece of information regarding Gmsh 4 is a change in the API: the
libjava-gmsh3 package in Debian was never meant to be a public API, and so Gmsh
upstream has requested that we no longer ship it. To offset this, there have
been refinements for the actual public API, which officially comes in C, Python
3 and (new) Julia flavors. However, I haven't found much information on Julia
packaging in Debian, so I'll likely hold off on that package.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pyside-2-rebuild-ppa-plans">
<h2>PySide 2 Rebuild &amp; PPA Plans</h2>
<p>Since FreeCAD is an LGPL-licensed Qt project, we must use PySide and not PyQt
to do Qt things with Python. Because of this, the FreeCAD migration to Qt 5 on
Debian was blocked by the packaging of PySide 2, which was completed by
Freexian SARL over the summer. In Debian, we now have a Qt 5-enabled FreeCAD,
although our daily builds PPA is still using Qt 4.</p>
<p>Besides the Qt 4-&gt;5 transition, we're also finishing up a Python 2-&gt;3
transition. At the end of the summer I published a <cite>freecad-python3</cite> package in
the PPA which also used Qt 5. However, it wasn't really fully usable, moreso a
proof-of-concept that such a build indeed buildable.</p>
<p>At this point, the Debian FreeCAD package has begun to diverge from the FreeCAD
PPAs; besides Qt 5 builds not being available currently, the Debian package has
also been split into several packages (e.g. <cite>libfreecad</cite>, <cite>freecad-common</cite>,
etc. packages) in order to better comply with Debian Policy and the Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard.</p>
<p>So, there's a bit of work to do to catch the PPAs up. First, the package split
needs to be done. Then, I need to upload an alternative <cite>freecad-daily</cite> package
for Qt 5 builds, separate from Python 3. Once that is done and has undergone
some testing, <cite>freecad-daily</cite> can be replaced by it, and it in turn can be
replaced by a <cite>freecad-python3</cite> package for further testing. Since FreeCAD's
0.18 release is imminent, I'll need to get this taken care of during December,
so stay tuned.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="packaging-in-progress">
<h2>Packaging in Progress</h2>
<p>My first packaging list is all the software I've already started packaging. For
some, it's almost complete, and for others, I've only just begun.</p>
<p>The purpose of these lists is not to give status updates, but to announce what
all I'm interested in to anyone reading this, and to give an idea of how much
packaging work I have in mind to improve this usage of Debian.</p>

The Building Information Model server (short: BIMserver) enables you to

related) project. Data is stored in the open standard IFC. The BIMserver is
not a fileserver, but it uses a model-driven architecture approach. This
means that IFC data is stored in an underlying database. The main advantage
of this approach is the ability to query, merge and filter the BIM-model

<p>The integration of BIM with FreeCAD is a very promising endeavor, and letting
FreeCAD be the client in a client-server model provides many potential
benefits. (This is the reason I'm working on PostCAD.) Packaging BIMserver
is a natural decision, then. However, it's a Java application, which I have
little experience with language-wise and none in terms of packaging it in
Debian, so this one has a bit of a difficulty associated with it.</p>

<p>CadQuery is an interesting project which actually makes use of FreeCAD, and
indeed FreeCAD even has a CadQuery Workbench. This would be nice to package as
a way of extending the FreeCAD ecosystem on Debian.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, CadQuery 2 is planning on moving away from FreeCAD to PythonOCC,
which is based on the now behind-the-times OpenCASCADE Community Edition fork,
based on OpenCASCADE 6.9.1; FreeCAD and other projects are moving back to the
mainline OpenCASCADE Technology project which is about to release version
7.4.0. It would be nice if both CadQuery and FreeCAD could instead move to use
PyOCCT as a middle-layer between itself and OpenCASCADE.</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Welcome to another monthly summary of my free software work. Currently I'm focusing
on improving the state of packaging for FreeCAD and its ecosystem of dependencies
and related packages in Debian Science. Additionally, I recently revived the <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/~freecad-community/+archive/ubuntu/ppa">FreeCAD
Community Extras PPA</a>
as a way of staging these packages out to users for testing. If
you are a FreeCAD user, developer, or simply a user of one of these packages, I would
greatly appreciate your feedback and testing to identify bugs while my packages wait
to make it into the Debian archive.</p>
<p>However, in the long-term, I plan to move away from spending so much time on Debian
packaging and returning to FreeCAD core development, and a special not-so-secret related project:
PostCAD, providing OpenCASCADE geometry &amp; topology bindings plus CAD data and filetype format support for PostgreSQL, a la PostGIS.
The goal is to build this out as a rich backend which FreeCAD can talk to about neat CAD stuff.
It's a heaping of work, though, so I don't expect to have a public release until mid or late 2019.</p>
<p>I would like to find others who
are interested in contributing to FreeCAD ecosystem packaging for mentorship. That way,
my efforts are maintained by the community and the quality and availability of packages
won't wane with my attention on them. Since FreeCAD participates in Google Summer of
Code, this would be a great opportunity for interested university students to learn
Debian packaging and improve the state of science &amp; engineering software on Debian.</p>
<p>Anyway, on to my summary!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debian-news">
<h2>Debian News</h2>
<p>This month, I officially became a Debian Maintainer. This is a basic level of formal
membership in the Debian project, and it comes with limited upload rights to the
archive. I can only upload packages for which I am marked as a maintainer, for example
FreeCAD.</p>
<p>I took advantage of this to upload some improvements for FreeCAD which I had
been sitting on. After a few tweaks, the package was ready for an upgraded upload
from Experimental to Unstable, which begins the process of candidacy for Testing,
the release pocket for the upcoming Debian 10.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debian-freecad-gets-qt-5">
<h2>Debian FreeCAD Gets Qt 5</h2>
<img alt="/images/freecad-qt5.png" class="align-center" src="../images/freecad-qt5.png"><p>Most important about this upload, though was that FreeCAD is finally being built
with Qt 5 support. While Qt 5 had been working for quite a while, we were waiting
on a dependency to be uploaded to Debian, PySide 2, which finally was uploaded this
summer. Because this is a big switch to flip, any testing and reporting of bugs for
this Debian package would be appreciated!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="freecad-package-structure-reorganization">
<h2>FreeCAD Package Structure Reorganization</h2>
<p>One of the other major packaging changes for FreeCAD 0.17 is that the package is
no longer a single, monolithic <tt class="docutils literal">freecad</tt> package. We now have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a <tt class="docutils literal">freecad</tt> metapackage, which installs the other packages</li>
<li>common files and resources (e.g. images) in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freecad-common</span></tt>
</li>
<li>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freecad-runtime</span></tt> contains Python 2/3 compatible runtime files</li>
<li>the executable built against Python 2, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freecad-python2</span></tt>
</li>
<li>and the library files used by the executable, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libfreecad-python2-0.17</span></tt>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several advantages to this approach. The first is that since <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freecad-common</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freecad-runtime</span></tt> are just pictures, Python scripts, and the like, we can save
space in the archive by only needing one copy of the package, instead of one for each
supported architecture. For <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freecad-python2</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libfreecad-python2-0.17</span></tt>, one can
see the advantage in the name: since these are Python 2 specific, we will soon be
able to provide their Python 3 counterparts.</p>
<p>Ideally, by the time of the Debian 10 release, the FreeCAD 0.17 package will provide
both Python 2 and 3 supported versions, and which one you want to use can be switched
between using the <tt class="docutils literal">alternatives</tt> system, which I will explain later in this post.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="freecad-python-3-imminent">
<h2>FreeCAD Python 3 Imminent</h2>
<p>Like Qt 5, FreeCAD has supported Python 3 for quite some time. (Workbenches and
3rd party code are another story.) However, in Debian, a Python 3-enabled FreeCAD
package is blocked by the pending upload of pivy 0.6. I helped coordinate the upstream
release of this package but due to issues with its dependency Coin3D the upload is stalled
until those issues are resolved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="community-extras-ppa-early-packge-previews">
<h2>Community Extras PPA - Early Packge Previews</h2>
<p>Now that we have the Community Extras PPA, it serves as a convenient location for me to upload packages
as soon as I have one completed and ready for testing. Here are my uploads this month.</p>
<div class="section" id="gmsh-4">
<h3>Gmsh 4</h3>
<img alt="/images/gmsh-airplane.png" class="align-center" src="../images/gmsh-airplane.png"><p><a class="reference external" href="http://gmsh.info/">Gmsh</a> has released a major version upgrade, which includes removing the
experimental Java API and introducing Julia bindings, although this package doesn't
do anything with them. The current version in the Debian archives is 3.0.6.</p>
<p>This package is only available on Bionic (Ubuntu 18.04) due to its dependencies. I hadn't tried on
Cosmic (Ubuntu 18.10) since I worked on this in the beginning of October and it wasn't released yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="calculix-2-14">
<h3>Calculix 2.14</h3>
<img alt="/images/calculix-turbocharger.jpeg" class="align-center" src="../images/calculix-turbocharger.jpeg"><p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.calculix.de/">CalculiX</a> in Debian is currently several versions behind (2.11) so I got a request
to package this. However, CalculiX actually spans several packages, but calculix-ccx,
the solver, is the only one used by FreeCAD, so unlike the other packages, this one
is not quite ready for Debian until the other ones are done as well, since they are
separate source packages.</p>
<p>This package is available on Bionic and Xenial (Ubuntu 16.04).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="translated-freecad-doc-packages">
<h3>Translated FreeCAD-Doc Packages</h3>
<p>One of the big areas for improvement in FreeCAD is the state of its documentation, and
I'm glad to announce that one big improvement is on its way. I have been working on
a standalone <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freecad-doc</span></tt> package, since it was removed from the Debian archive for
being derived from pre-compiled binary files. This package involves using a local
synced copy of the FreeCAD Wiki text and images, and using the script that was used
to generate the aforementioned binary files.</p>
<p>The main improvement my package offers is support for the two most complete translations
of the FreeCAD wiki, French and Italian. This is accomplished by making <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freecad-doc</span></tt>
a metapackage which depends on any one of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freecad-doc-en</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-it</span></tt>, or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-fr</span></tt> being installed.
Then, the relevant files in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freecad-doc</span></tt> upon which <tt class="docutils literal">freecad</tt> will call are in fact
managed symlinks to the appropriate translations. The symlinks are managed by the
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianAlternatives">DebianAlternatives</a> system (see update-alternatives(1).)</p>
<p>In order to switch between translations if more than one is installed, you can run
<tt class="docutils literal">sudo <span class="pre">update-alternatives</span> <span class="pre">--config</span> <span class="pre">freecad-doc</span></tt>. This will control the in-program help for FreeCAD,
so when you click the "What's this?" button, the resultant help page will be the translated version.</p>
<p>Additionally, compiled PDFs of the FreeCAD help are provided for all three languages.</p>
<p>One result of the nature of this package is that it is quite large: each <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freecad-doc</span></tt> translated package
weighs in about 300 MB so the combined size is about 1.2 GB, per Ubuntu distribution.</p>
<p>As a result, this package is only available on Bionic and Xenial.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pycollada-0-6-now-with-python-3">
<h3>PyCOLLADA 0.6, now with Python 3!</h3>
<img alt="/images/collada.jpeg" class="align-center" src="../images/collada.jpeg"><p>Another package which is fairly out of date in Debian (version 0.4 present), I decided
to update it since <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pycollada/pycollada">pycollada</a> is a dependency of FreeCAD and I am intrigued by the possibilities
of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COLLADA">COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) format</a>.
This allows for interchange with interactive 3D applications like Blender.</p>
<p>The big news with this package is that Python 3 support is now available, so I updated the source packaging
to provide both Python 2 and 3 packages.</p>
<p>Again due to dependencies, it's only available on Cosmic and Bionic.</p>

<p>Hello all, unfortunately my update comes late again this month, although I have good reason! I just finished landing a job
as a scientific software developer. From the looks of it, I'll mostly be working on things from a systems engineering perspective,
but it'll be in the context of the scientific Python ecosystem as well as involving Qt. This is nice in that while I will have less
free time to spend on FreeCAD, it will almost certainly be of increasingly higher quality.</p>
<p>Another interesting benefit of the job is that it will allow me to move back to Austin, which has the very well-equipped hackerspace
<a class="reference external" href="http://atxhs.org">ATX Hackerspace</a>. I look forward to joining and having a chance to finally experiment with FreeCAD's CNC integrations,
and to have a great space to hack on hardware and software.</p>
<p>Now, finally, to summarize what I've worked on in the month of September.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I created a <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=31046">thread on the FreeCAD forums</a> to announce the revival of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/~freecad-community/+archive/ubuntu/ppa">FreeCAD Community Extras PPA</a>. This will be used to host packages of interest
to the FreeCAD community, and things that need testing for possible future inclusion in FreeCAD. In retrospect, I should have used this PPA to get
testers for the packages I was working on during my last Google Summer of Code.</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>To this FreeCAD Community Extras PPA, I uploaded packages for:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aewallin/opencamlib">OpenCAMLIB</a>, a C++ library with Python bindings for creating 3D toolpaths for CNC machines such as mills and lathes.</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aewallin/openvoronoi">OpenVoronoi</a>, another C++/Python library for 2D Voronoi diagrams for point and line-segment sites.</li>
<li>Laughlin Research's standalone <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LaughlinResearch/SMESH">SMESH</a>, the Salome meshing framework.</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NGSolve/netgen">Netgen</a>'s latest release, 6.2.1807, a 3D tetrahedral mesh generator.</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell">IfcOpenShell</a>, an open source Python IFC library and geometry engine.</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ifcquery/ifcplusplus">IfcPlusPlus</a>, an open source C++ class model, reader, and writer for IFC files with simple Qt/OpenSceneGraph viewer application.</li>
</ul></dd>
</dl></li>
<li>I have long been interested in having CAD database support, and I spent quite a bit of September working with my friend on research and initial work for this. From what we've found,
we can feasibly have a PostgreSQL extension similar to PostGIS, but for CAD: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/postcad">PostCAD</a>. This would mainly involve a marriage between <a class="reference external" href="https://www.opencascade.com/">OpenCASCADE</a>, the C++ geometry and topology kernel of FreeCAD,
and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jtv/libpqxx">libpqxx</a>, the official C++ client library for PostgreSQL. The potential for such an extension would be huge, with all the power and features
of PostgreSQL with an understanding of CAD data and geometry. For example, FreeCAD could interface with this database, and have the database take care of things like editing locks
for models, permissions for readingn and writing of models, and so forth. Furthermore, by creating a database-level abstraction for CAD, that opens the way for web abstractions
for CAD, similar to GeoDjango's GIS extensions for Django. That work could one day pave the way for a web interface for FreeCAD.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, if you appreciate the work I do with FreeCAD, the Debian Science Team, and Open Engineering on Linux, any level of support would be appreciated
<a class="reference external" href="https://patreon.com/kkremitzki">on my Patreon!</a> Currently this money helps offset server costs for some of the experimental FreeCAD community stuff.
I would like to continue to use it to offset my costs for FreeCAD development and equipment. If I can reach my current goal of $100/month, I'd like to
use it to purchase a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=3707">Pinebook, a $99 ARM64 laptop</a> which I could use for FreeCAD &amp; Debian ARM development.
I'd really like FreeCAD to be usable (and not painfully slow) on ARM since its low-cost nature means it is highly available for educational institutions.
Maybe one day I'll even be able to afford milling/CNC equipment so I can see just how far FreeCAD integration can take us!</p>

<p>Hello all! After reading some of the nice activity logs published by members of the
Debian Project at <a class="reference external" href="https://planet.debian.org">https://planet.debian.org</a>, I've decided to publish my own version.
This will mostly be my work on FreeCAD and Debian, but will also include other points
of note from my many interests. I'll also include relevant activities for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.patreon.com/kkremitzki">my supporters
on Patreon</a></p>
<p>As covered in my previous post, most of the first half of August was spent finishing
my Google Summer of Code project for FreeCAD, which largely turned into "packaging
for the Debian Science Team" since FreeCAD's dependency chain and options for
integration are so vast. However, the nature of the work is highly parallel.
For example, when packaging, most issues occur either almost immediately into the build,
or after the build has finished. This means that after an initial bit of packaging work
that allows a build to actually proceed, one then has to launch the build and wait
anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to see the next issue arise. So, as a
result, I worked on <em>many</em> packages in parallel. A negative consequence of this was
that I somewhat overloaded my plate in terms of things I can handle, so in actuality
this meant I would work on a handful of packages on several machines at once, and then
once those issues were largely resolved I would move onto another handful, rather
than really juggling them all at once.</p>
<p>After finishing GSoC, I first turned my attention to two of the packages I had
worked on in parallel, python-fluids and python-ulmo.</p>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/python-fluids">python-fluids</a></h2>
<p>I made a new upload for this package to correct several issues. Here's an excerpt from the changelog:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
* [1215102] Make python-fluids-doc Multi-Arch: foreign
* [eb610fd] Correct Vcs-* fields
* [62570cd] Updated to Standards-Version 4.2.0, no change required
* [29e96a7] Correct debian/watch
* [3e90d05] Add missing scipy dependency
* [cd776a2] Add lintian override for
  package-contains-documentation-outside-usr-share-doc
</pre>
<p>The package still fails some reproducibility tests on i386 and could use a standards version bump, but other
than that, this package is almost completely clean now! It's quite satisfying cleaning up these packages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/python-ulmo">python-ulmo</a></h2>
<p>I made an upload for this package as well:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
* [7150daa] Correct Vcs-* fields
* [027b50b] Mark python-ulmo-doc as Multi-Arch: foreign
* [d72b6f6] Add patch to fix FutureWarning
</pre>
<p>The package was failing its autopkgtests because Python was emitting a FutureWarning onto stderr.
This package is actually fully reproducible, and only needs a standards version bump to be fully clean.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gmsh">gmsh</a></h2>
<p>On August 22nd, <a class="reference external" href="http://gmsh.info/">Gmsh 4.0.0 was released!</a> The Java API was removed and a Julia one added.
This is a nice release because in
<a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=904946">Debian bug #904946</a> it was found that the Gmsh package, after being updated to
be built against OCCT instead of OCE, actually no longer worked when used in FreeCAD, giving the error:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Error   : Gmsh requires OpenCASCADE to import shape
</pre>
<p>My hope was that by updating to the new Gmsh version, this problem would resolve itself. However, I ran into a few problems and had to postpone
finishing up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id4">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/netgen">netgen</a></h2>
<p>On August 19th, <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=906619">Debian bug #906619</a> was reported against Netgen, which was
an occasion to look at the state of the package. I noticed that upstream had released version 6.2.1807 (versus the current .1804) but
it was not tagged in the Netgen repository, only as a submodule of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ngsolve/ngsolve">Ngsolve repository</a>.</p>
<p>On August 31st, I packaged the new version and resolved the bug
in <a class="reference external" href="https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/netgen/merge_requests/9/commits">science-team/netgen PR #9</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="salome-smesh">
<h2>salome-smesh</h2>
<p>Although technically not August, on September 3rd I pushed the <a class="reference external" href="https://salsa.debian.org/kkremitzki-guest/salome-smesh">nearly finished package for a standalone salome-smesh on Salsa</a>
which is fully functional except for an issue with the CMake config file. I submitted a pull request to support multi-arch for the package
but forgot to update the path in the CMake config file, so the variables therein have to be manually set, or the file edited.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cantera">
<h2>cantera</h2>
<p>On August 24th, Cantera 2.4.0 was released:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Cantera is an open-source suite of tools for problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes.
</pre>
<p>Previously there had been an issue with the build, where the packages would be made successfully, but attempting to <cite>import cantera</cite> in
Python would error out, presumably due to the way an included copy of libfmt was handled during the build. However, the issue is no longer
present, so I now have a working Cantera 2.4.0 package! The only shortcoming is that I don't have working docs build yet, so this package
didn't make it in time for August.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id5">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/openfoam">openfoam</a></h2>
<p>Previously I had submitted a pull request for OpenFOAM 6 to the Debian Science Team, but spontaneously the package began to fail,
presumably due to some change in a dependency. I spent some time troubleshooting this issue but haven't found a resolution yet.
Here's a snippet of the build failure:</p>

<p>I'll have to continue investigating this one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id6">
<h2><a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/pyside2">pyside2</a></h2>
<p>I reported <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=906020">Debian bug #906020</a> about missing Python 3 CMake config files,
which was fixed Aug 28th. I began investigating how this would Pivy builds, but got sidetracked by a problem with the <cite>med-fichier</cite> package.</p>

<p>There are several instances of this throughout the codebase that can basically be fixed with by adding some <cite>#include</cite> s.</p>

<div class="section" id="projectchrono">
<h2>projectchrono</h2>
<p>There was a bit of discussion about utilization of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.projectchrono.org/">Project Chrono</a>, an open source multi-physics simulation engine,
in FreeCAD. One problem with pursuing this is that it isn't packaged at all for Debian, which is rather surprising! It seems like high-quality software.
I began looking at packaging it and it actually doesn't seem that bad. One of the main issues is actually the naming: it's really long! There's also a
bit of worry about naming collisions I'll have to look into. As of now, I have a working package except for the Python bindings. Enabling them results
in this failure in the build process:</p>

<p>I spent some time researching the state of the package, but it's fairly rough, and most importantly, upstream is far from active. I'd like to run the RSS service but

<p>Hello all! This post is my final work product for GSoC 2018 for the FreeCAD project.
The main center for communication for FreeCAD is the forums, but we also coordinated things
through the #freecad channel on Freenode.
<a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=28478">The main thread for my project was here.</a></p>
<p>To summarize my project: FreeCAD is a complex application with an extensive dependency tree. The packaging
situation has always trailed the tip of development, which means users don't get to see the best FreeCAD
has to offer, and people trying to help new users have to deal with sometimes years-old bugs.
The goal was to improve the general ecosystem of the FreeCAD stack, and to cut down on technical debt to
make things easier moving forward. After some consideration it was decided to focus on Debian packaging
since that would be the most 'ecologically good'.</p>
<p>I began with a rough knowledge of Debian packaging, but now feel competent
enough to want to take over the maintenance of Debian packaging for FreeCAD and several other packages
within the Debian Science Team, which will improve the free software engineering experience in Debian
as well as its derivatives such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint. In fact, I plan on trying to offically become
a Debian Maintainer and then Debian Developer. On the 4th of July during the middle of the project
I drove to Houston for a GPG keysigning, so the wheels are already in motion.</p>
<p>This post will summarize my work throughout the summer chronologically, mostly linking to emails in
the Debian Science mailing list, pull requests on Debian's Gitlab instance or Github, and to some repositories.</p>

<p>Now that GSoC is done I am excited to continue working within the Debian Science Team. Besides an upcoming FreeCAD 0.18 release,
I have several packages I plan to make improvements to and to package for Debian, and ultimately to integrate into future
FreeCAD workbenches as part of my plan to make it the ultimate 3D engineering toolbox!</p>
<p>Therefore, I must say thanks to the FreeCAD and Debian communities for working with me, and to my GSoC mentors and GSoC itself
for providing me this wonderful opportunity. May it continue providing valuable opportunities for others for many years to come.</p>

<p>2017 has been an incredible year for me with lots of opportunities, but many
challenges as well. In the spring, I got a (lab) teaching opportunity for a
50-student Measurement &amp; Control of Biological Systems course, culminating in
17 teams making maze-solving autonomous robots. There's a higher level of
mastery to be attained by teaching others, and in that regard, it was an
incredible experience. Teaching, however, is well outside my comfort zone, and
in that regard it had some difficulties.</p>
<p>In the summer, I was able to work on a Google Summer of Code project/pseudo-internship.
Working in a mix of Python and C++ was again an interesting challenge since
I'm much more familiar with the former than the latter, and even my experience
with other languages lies on the Python side of the interpreted/compiled,
dynamic/static typing divide. Still, it was an invaluable experience since C++
rules the domain of finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics,
which I want to explore further. Particularly, FreeCAD is the perfect vehicle for
engineering computer modeling, so I have high hopes for my future with the project.</p>
<p>At the end of the summer, I passed the exam for the Linux Foundation Certified
System Administrator. This was an opportunity provided by a scholarship given
in part because of my work using Python to analyze the efficiency of backyard
irrigation systems in the Yucat√°n back in early 2016, so it was great to finally
see the culmination of that work. As a little celebration project, I decided to
begin running my own Linux mail server, which has been a great success. There
were a few hiccups with blacklists on Yahoo and Outlook, but I was ultimately
able to get it working with all the major email providers.</p>
<p>I also embarked on a project I've been wanting to do for a long time: running
my own Linux router. I found a great series of tutorials on setting up such a
router using Ubuntu and the Pine64 board, and have had excellent results since.</p>
<p>I have also been spending time here and there researching a really promising
project, FreeIPA. It's a sort of competitor to Active Directory in the identity
management space, mostly made up of a combination of an LDAP, Kerberos, and
certificate server. I'm running a sort of pseudo-small business in my home
network using my FreeIPA server as a centralized authentication, authorization,
and identity server, and it's been a great experience so far; I hope to apply it
in reality with the FreeCAD project one day. Look out for future posts on the
topic.</p>
<p>In the fall, I began my final year at Texas A&amp;M. My capstone project and team
was assigned. Our project involves analyzing the flood resiliency of the Houston
area and proposing an ecological engineering design to improve that resiliency and
mitigate the effects of future extreme flood events such as was seen during
Hurricane Harvey. We are using an open-source toolchain involving PostGIS, Python,
and QGIS, and the project is really quite exciting since our analysis could be applied
to other coastal cities and regions facing extreme weather events in the future.</p>
<p>Altogether, it's been a great year, but I foresee 2018 being even better. If
you're reading this, I want to wish you a happy new year with hope for the same!</p>
