since I last wrote!  Because this update covers August, September, and October,
I'll try to be brief and only touch on the key points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="staging-merging-app-link-functionality"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="/blog/halloween-update-for-freecad-debian-science-work/#id1"&gt;Staging &amp;amp; Merging App::Link Functionality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="App::Link example" src="/images/applink.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The "App::Link" object allows lightweight linking of objects in a document
and from external documents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, a major milestone towards unified, mainline mechanical assembly
functionality in FreeCAD was reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core challenges in implementing assembly functionality is the
problem of topological naming. In a CAD model there are topological entities,
such as solids, faces, edges, and vertices. We must choose some algorithm to
name them so that you can refer to relationships to make an assembly. A simple
example would be two cubes, connected by touching faces. If a parameter in your
model changes, and after recalculation, your "Face_N" is on the wrong side of
the cube, your assembly may break, or not be what you are expecting. Without a
good approach to topological naming, parametric FreeCAD models won't be robust
to changes and recalculations, which defeats the purpose of parametric
modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is such a difficult problem, progress has been slow. However,
recently a relatively new FreeCAD developer, 'realthunder', put significant
work towards this problem, with a solution finally on the horizon. Because it
required major changes to FreeCAD's internals, the review and testing period
was and continues to be lengthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The milestone in particular was merging of a large chunk of this code, referred
to in short as "App::Link functionality". This diff is huge: &lt;em&gt;+70,441&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;-14,562&lt;/em&gt; lines of C++. You can &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2350"&gt;read more about it on the pull request itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only played a minor contributing role in this effort, preparing a short-lived
staging PPA to provide a package for testers after the pull request was opened
in July, but it's rather significant news in terms of the project and so worth
spreading. Mechanical assembly is (no surprise) a must-have for mechanical
engineers interested in FreeCAD, and it's considered by some to be the last
remaining blocker for FreeCAD's 1.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra links: notes for code reviewers from the PR author, for the dedicated
readers out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="freecad-python-2-removal-in-debian-testing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="/blog/halloween-update-for-freecad-debian-science-work/#id2"&gt;FreeCAD Python 2 removal in Debian Testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python 2 removal in Debian Testing continues, and with it, FreeCAD's Python
2 package is gone. However, upon upload, several new build failures appeared on
the i386, mipsel, and s390x platforms. Turns out there was a regression in dwz,
a software I had never heard of before. I tried troubleshooting but
unfortunately had FreeCAD drop out of testing due to the Python 2 removal bug
filed against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, when I &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=942193"&gt;filed a bug against dwz&lt;/a&gt;, Matthias Klose
and Tom de Vries helped isolate and upstream the problem, with Tom even
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25109"&gt;bisecting the regressing commit in the upstream bug&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you, you two!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adding a workaround to fix those build failures, the new Python 3-only
FreeCAD package is on its way to Debian Testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="freecad-python-3-support-added-for-ubuntu-16-04"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="/blog/halloween-update-for-freecad-debian-science-work/#id3"&gt;FreeCAD Python 3 support added for Ubuntu 16.04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qt 5 &amp;amp; Python 3 builds for FreeCAD have been available on Ubuntu 18.04 and
newer and Debian 10 and newer platforms for some time now. However, Ubuntu
16.04 was problematic due to its old Qt version, which meant a Qt 4, Python 3
build had to be produced. This had been on the back burner for a while because
when I initially attempted backporting the necessary packages, I encountered
some friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since it's the last holdout Python 2 platform, I took another look at
things to try to speed up the "py2ectomy". It turns out that the missing
package needed for a Python 3 build, pivy, was failing to build because of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.debian.org/Hardening#DEB_BUILD_HARDENING_PIE_.28gcc.2Fg.2B-.2B-_-fPIE_-pie.29"&gt;"PIE hardening"&lt;/a&gt;,
a Debian security hardening flag. I had all such flags turned on, so I just had
to disable that particular one to get things going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Python 3 builds are now available for Ubuntu 16.04 in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/freecad-daily"&gt;FreeCAD Daily
Builds PPA&lt;/a&gt;,
and they will be coming soon to the stable PPA as well. A new bugfix release
has been made for stable, 0.18.4, so I am working on that first, and the Python
3 package will come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="netgen-and-pybind11-builds"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="/blog/halloween-update-for-freecad-debian-science-work/#id4"&gt;Netgen and Pybind11 Builds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news for users of FreeCAD's finite element modeling workbench!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration with Netgen, a mesh generator, has long been an optional but
off-by-default build option for FreeCAD, due to packaging difficulties.
However, since I have taken over things in recent years, I have finally gotten
things to the state where we can turn this back on by default. As part of this
change, I am also building FreeCAD with Pybind11 instead of Boost.Python,
marking another milestone in managing FreeCAD's dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this may introduce bugs, I've started by making this change for all of
FreeCAD's daily builds in the Ubuntu PPA, as well as the package currently in
Debian Unstable. Eventually, this change may come to the stable PPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="opencascade-7-4-0"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="/blog/halloween-update-for-freecad-debian-science-work/#id5"&gt;OpenCASCADE 7.4.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="OCCT performance improvement example" src="/images/occt740.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An assembly of a single solid box replicated ~93,000 times. This test case is more than 10x faster in OCCT 7.4.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.opencascade.com/sites/default/files/documents/release_notes_7.4.0.pdf"&gt;After more than a year of development&lt;/a&gt; (PDF warning), a new
minor version of OpenCASCADE Technology (OCCT) has been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCCT is the geometry &amp;amp; topology kernel of FreeCAD, and it is also a dependency
for several related projects including Gmsh, IFCOpenShell, Netgen, and
OpenCAMLib. New releases in OCCT generally herald stability and performance
upgrades for core behavior. However, there are some breaking changes and so
these improvements are yet to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being, OCCT 7.4.0 packages are available in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/~kkremitzki/+archive/ubuntu/opencascade"&gt;my OpenCASCADE PPA&lt;/a&gt; and by
building the package directly from
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/opencascade"&gt;https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/opencascade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I uploaded &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://openfoam.com/releases/openfoam-v1906/index.php"&gt;the latest version of OpenFOAM&lt;/a&gt;, the toolbox for
computational fluid dynamics. It's now available in Ubuntu 19.10, Debian
Testing, and via the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/~freecad-community/+archive/ubuntu/ppa"&gt;FreeCAD Community Extras PPA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gmsh-4-4-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="/blog/halloween-update-for-freecad-debian-science-work/#id7"&gt;Gmsh 4.4.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt"&gt;The latest version of Gmsh&lt;/a&gt;, a 3D finite
element mesh generator, is also in Ubuntu 19.10, Debian Testing, and the
Community Extras PPA. Thanks to Nico Schlömer for helping maintain this
package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="netgen-6-2-1905"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="/blog/halloween-update-for-freecad-debian-science-work/#id8"&gt;Netgen 6.2.1905&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version of Netgen is only available via the FreeCAD Daily and Community
Extras PPAs. Unfortunately Netgen has been stuck in the Debian NEW queue for
over 8 months now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was accepted into the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sponsors/kkremitzki/"&gt;GitHub Sponsors&lt;/a&gt; program! GitHub is matching
donations for the first year. Hopefully this helps fund my FOSS work, and FOSS

and the Debian Science team. I call it a summer update because it was winter
when I last wrote, and quite some time has elapsed since I fell out of the
monthly update habit. This is a high-level summary of what I've been working on
since March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="freecad-0-18-release-debian-10-full-freeze-timing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FreeCAD 0.18 Release &amp;amp; Debian 10 Full Freeze Timing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/freecadsplash.png" class="align-center" src="/images/freecadsplash.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official release date of FreeCAD 0.18
( &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Release_notes_0.18"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; )
is March 12, 2019, although the git tag for it wasn't pushed until March 14th.
This timing was a bit unfortunate as the full freeze for Debian 10 went into
effect March 12th, with a de-facto freeze date of March 2nd due to the 10 day
testing migration period. To compound things, since this was my first Debian
release as a packaging contributor, I didn't do things quite right such that
while I probably could have gotten FreeCAD 0.18 into Debian 10, I didn't.
Instead, what's available is a pre-release version from about a month before
the release which is missing a few bugfixes and refinements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, this is an impetus for me to learn about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://backports.debian.org/"&gt;Debian
Backports&lt;/a&gt;, a way to provide non-bugfix
updates to Debian Stable users. The 0.18 release line has already had several
bugfix releases; I've currently got Debian Testing/Unstable as well as the
Ubuntu Stable PPA up-to-date with version 0.18.3. As soon as I'm able, I'll get
this version into Debian Backports, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="freecad-ppa-improvements"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FreeCAD PPA Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nice improvement I've recently made is migrating the packaging for the
Ubuntu Stable and Daily PPAs to Debian's GitLab instance at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/freecad"&gt;https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/freecad&lt;/a&gt; by creating the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ppa/master&lt;/tt&gt; and
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ppa/daily&lt;/tt&gt; branches. Having all the Debian and Ubuntu packaging in one place
means that propagating updates has become a matter of git merging and pushing.
Once any changes are in place, I simply have to trigger an import and build on
Launchpad for the stable releases. For the daily builds, changes are
automatically synced and the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;debian&lt;/tt&gt; directory from Salsa is combined with the
latest synced upstream source from GitHub, so daily builds no longer have to be
triggered manually. However, this has uncovered another problem in our process
which being worked on at the FreeCAD forums. (Thread: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;amp;t=37216"&gt;Finding a solution for
the 'version.h' issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="science-team-package-updates"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Science Team Package Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/bunny.png" class="align-center" src="/images/bunny.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main Science Team packages I've been working on recently have been
OpenCASCADE, Netgen, Gmsh, and OpenFOAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For OpenCASCADE, I have uploaded the third bugfix release in the 7.3.0 series.
Unfortunately, their versioning scheme is a bit unusual, so this version is tagged 7.3.0p3.
This is unfortunate because &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;dpkg &lt;span class="pre"&gt;--compare-versions&lt;/span&gt; 7.3.0p3+dfsg1 gt
7.3.0+dfsg1&lt;/tt&gt; evaluates to false. As such, I've uploaded this package as 7.3.3,
with plans to contact upstream to discuss their bugfix release versioning
scheme. Currently, version 7.4.0 has an upstream target release date for the
end of August, so there will be an opportunity to convince them to release
7.4.1 instead of 7.4.0p1. If you're interested in the changes contained in this
upload, you can refer to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://git.dev.opencascade.org/gitweb/?p=occt.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/tags/V7_3_0p3"&gt;upstream git log&lt;/a&gt;
for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Nico Schlömer and Anton Gladky, the newest Gmsh, version
4.4.1, has been uploaded to wait in the Debian NEW queue. See &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt"&gt;the upstream
changelog&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on what's new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also prepared the package for the newest version of Netgen, 6.2.1905.
Unfortunately, uploading this is blocked because 6.2.1810 is still in Debian
NEW. However, I've tested compiling FreeCAD against Netgen, and I've been able
to get the integration with it working again, so once I'm able to do this
upload, I'll be able to upload a new and improved FreeCAD with the power of
Netgen meshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also begun working on packaging the latest OpenFOAM release, 1906. I've
gotten a little sidetracked, though, as a pecularity in the way upstream
prepares their tarballs seems to be triggering a bug in GNU tar. I should have
this one uploaded soon. For a preview in what'll be coming, see the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.openfoam.com/releases/openfoam-v1906/"&gt;release
notes for version 1906&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gitlab-ci-experimentation-with-salsa-debian-org"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitLab CI Experimentation with salsa.debian.org&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some incredibly awesome Debian contributors have set up the ability to use
GitLab CI to automate the testing of Debian packages (see &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa/Doc#Running_Continuous_Integration_.28CI.29_tests"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of experimentation with it. Unfortunately, both OpenCASCADE and
FreeCAD exceeded the 2 hour time limit. There's a lot of promise in it for
smaller packages, though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-2-removal-in-debian-underway"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python 2 Removal in Debian Underway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/deadsnakes.jpeg" class="align-center" src="/images/deadsnakes.jpeg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pythonclock.org"&gt;pythonclock.org&lt;/a&gt;, Python 2 has less than 5
months until it's end-of-life, so the task of removing it for the next version
of Debian has begun. For now, it's mainly limited to leaf packages with nothing
depending on them. As such, I've uploaded Python 3-only packages for new
upstream releases of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;python-fluids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (a fluid dynamics engineering &amp;amp; design
library) and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;python-ulmo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (provides clean &amp;amp; simple access to public hydrology
and climatology data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="debian-developer-application"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debian Developer Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've finally applied to become a full Debian Developer, which is an exciting
prospect. I'll be more able to enact improvements without having to bug, well,
mostly Anton, Andreas, and Tobias. (Thanks!) I'm also looking forward to having
access to more resources to improve my packages on other architectures,
particularly arm64 now that the Raspberry Pi 4 is out and potentially a serious
candidate for a low-powered FreeCAD workstation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is slow and calculating, as it should be, so it'll be some time
before I'm officially in, but it sure will be cause for celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm mentoring a Google Summer of Code project for FreeCAD this year! (See
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=35493"&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt;.) My
student is quite new to FreeCAD and Debian/Ubuntu, so the first half of the
project has involved relatively the deep-end topics of using Debian packaging
to distribute bugfixes for FreeCAD and to learn by exploring related packages
in its ecosystem. In particular, focus was given to OpenCAMLib, since there is
a lot of user and developer interest in FreeCAD's potential for generating
toolpaths for machining and manufacturing the models created in the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he's officially swimming and not sinking, the next phase is working on
making development and packaging-related improvements for FreeCAD on Windows,
which is in even rougher shape than Debian/Ubuntu, but more his area of
familiarity. Stay tuned for the final results!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello all and welcome again to another of my monthly summary posts on my work
in free software, with a focus on open engineering in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.debian.org/"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ubuntu.com/"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm
fortunate to have the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2019/02/msg00008.html"&gt;February 12th Debian 10 soft freeze deadline&lt;/a&gt; to
scapegoat for my missed January update, and thanks too to February for being
short enough to postpone it further and combine the two updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decided to go with a bit of a dryer chronological approach to this update
as there's lots to cover. Worth highlighting, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="highlights"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Debian upload for a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/"&gt;FreeCAD&lt;/a&gt; 0.18 pre-release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Debian upload for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.openfoam.com/"&gt;OpenFOAM&lt;/a&gt;. An upstream
switch from openfoam.org to openfoam.com and a different versioning scheme
results in a massive version bump, 4.1 to 1812. That's over 1800 versions better.
(Seriously though, it's about a 2 year bump in changes.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Debian uploads for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_generation"&gt;mesh generation&lt;/a&gt; softwares &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gmsh.info/"&gt;Gmsh&lt;/a&gt; 4.1.3 and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ngsolve.org/"&gt;Netgen&lt;/a&gt; 6.2.1810 --
though Netgen might miss Debian 10? It's stuck in the NEW queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FreeCAD is participating in Google Summer of Code and I'm looking for a
student to mentor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://freecadweb.org/tracker"&gt;FreeCAD bug tracker&lt;/a&gt; to the latest
version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jan 12: Completed transition of FreeCAD PPAs to new versions of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin3D"&gt;Coin3D&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; its Python bindings package Pivy,
which &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=26599"&gt;resolved a major breakage caused by me on Dec 29&lt;/a&gt; but was a necessary
precursor to a FreeCAD 0.18 release; I just didn't execute it as well as I
should have&lt;/li&gt;

of OpenFOAM 1812.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jan 18: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aewallin/opencamlib/issues/31#issuecomment-455452094"&gt;Discussed on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
with the upstream of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.anderswallin.net/cam/"&gt;OpenCAMLib&lt;/a&gt; about
release plans now that it is Python 3 compatible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jan 19: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/libMesh/libmesh/issues/2003"&gt;Contact via GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://libmesh.github.io/"&gt;libMesh&lt;/a&gt; upstream about Debian packaging, with
enthusiastic response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jan 19: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/1916"&gt;FreeCAD pull request&lt;/a&gt; to fix Start Workbench
behavior in Debian/Ubuntu since we can't include binary &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/File_Format_FCStd"&gt;.FCStd&lt;/a&gt; examples, even though
they're glorified ZIPs, for Debian Free Software Guidelines reasons (or can we?
please contact me if you know otherwise)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jan 25-27: Hosted &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/2019/01/us/Austin"&gt;Austin Debian Bug Squashing Party&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, it wasn't
very successful in drawing in people besides those already interested in Debian
at the host venue, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://atxhs.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;ATX Hackerspace&lt;/a&gt;. I
didn't want to over-advertise it since the venue was limited in capacity, which
in retrospect was a mistake. Oh well, there was also plenty to learn for the
next one. The following bugs were closed: 918479, 888026, 884092, 886538,
882510, 899099, 920525, 919711.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jan 26: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=26599"&gt;Announced&lt;/a&gt; the experimental
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://staging.freecad.io"&gt;staging.freecad.io&lt;/a&gt;, an instance of FreeCAD's
homepage designed to test possible improvements to be had by moving away from
shared hosting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jan 28: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sfepy/sfepy/issues/496"&gt;Contact via GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sfepy.org/doc-devel/index.html"&gt;sfepy&lt;/a&gt; upstream about it failing to build

into Unstable, thanks Anton Gladky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feb 4: Announced &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.freecad.io"&gt;tracker.freecad.io&lt;/a&gt;, an
experimental instance of FreeCAD's bug tracker designed to test possible
improvements to be had from moving away from shared hosting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feb 5: Regained control of abandoned FreeCAD Snap, which was a pre-release of
0.17, by way of the uploader returning from MIA and adding me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feb 9: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Homepage/pull/33"&gt;Merge PR&lt;/a&gt; for
FreeCAD-Homepage repo to add Expires headers and unset ETags to try to get
better performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feb 13: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sfepy/sfepy/issues/496#issuecomment-463089344"&gt;Confirmed sfepy upstream fix resolved the issue&lt;/a&gt;, but it
came a day after the soft freeze preventing re-entry to Testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feb 23: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1031845/accepted-python-fluids-0173-1-source-into-unstable/"&gt;Upload&lt;/a&gt;

organizations announced. FreeCAD participating under umbrella organization
OpenCAx led by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://brlcad.org/"&gt;BRL-CAD&lt;/a&gt;. I created a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/13"&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; for the project I'd like to
mentor. I'm looking for a student interested in improving the state of Debian &amp;amp;
Ubuntu packaging for FreeCAD and its ecosystem of packages. Particularly -- not
everyone's first encounter with FreeCAD is with the latest and greatest
version. If someone installs an old version and has a bad experience with an
easily fixable packaging bug, we should try to tackle that issue to not drive
away people who are already interested, but get a bad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feb 25: Sponsored &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ftp-master.debian.org/new/netgen_6.2.1810+dfsg1-1.html"&gt;upload&lt;/a&gt; of Netgen to
Unstable, thanks Anton Gladky. Netgen had to re-enter NEW because I made a
mistake in the naming of the binary package, so I had to revise the package to
make libnglib-6.2 (for the .1810 release) replace libnglib-6.2.1804.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feb 25: Sponsored &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ftp-master.debian.org/new/pycollada_0.6-1.html"&gt;upload&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pycollada/pycollada"&gt;pycollada&lt;/a&gt; which adds Python 3
support and a python3- package, so it has to pass through NEW again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feb 28: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1033005/accepted-opencascade-730dfsg1-5-source-into-unstable/"&gt;Upload&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.opencascade.com/"&gt;OpenCASCADE&lt;/a&gt;, revising the package to
revert to the default 'opencascade' installation paths instead of 'occt' (a
not-so-great packaging decision as OpenCASCADE was my 2nd ever Debian package)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another of my monthly summaries on my work in the free software
world. My mission is to make engineering and science available for everyone,
and Debian, the Universal Operating System, is my weapon of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received some feedback on my last post that I made it seem I would be
stepping away from my role maintaining FreeCAD and other packages on the Debian
Science Team, which was an unfortunate miscommunication on my part. Mainly, I
just would like to reduce the proportion of my overall free software time on
it, from its current amount, nearly 100%, to a roughly even 1/3rd split between
Debian Science, FreeCAD, and PostCAD. The latter is a promising personal
project to make an OpenCASCADE-powered CAD extension for PostgreSQL, bringing
support for CAD file formats, datatypes, and algorithms to the powerful
Postgres ecosystem, similar to what PostCAD has done for geospatial analysis.
This could serve as a backend for both FreeCAD in the short term, and in the
long term, it could power a web-based version of FreeCAD, perhaps with some
Django-powered middleware serving a REST API for some WebGL-based frontend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, besides summarizing my work this month, I also plan to give a synopsis on
my Debian packaging, for both what's in-progress and on my wishlist. As you'll
see, it's quite extensive. My hope is that by whittling away at both lists, my
Debian Science work can focus more on maintenance of existing packages, and
free up some time for other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sponsors"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sponsors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work on Debian Science, FreeCAD, and PostCAD is &lt;cite&gt;supported by my patrons on
Patreon &amp;lt;https://patreon.com/kkremitzki&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt;. While I had created a Liberapay a
while back, I never got any traction with it, and I found out recently that it
was because I had not set it up to actually receive payments. So, if you don't
like Patreon for whatever reason, you can also &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://liberapay.com/kkremitzki"&gt;support me on Liberapay&lt;/a&gt;. Just to round things out, if you don't
like either of those platforms, you can also &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://paypal.me/kkremitzki"&gt;help support my work via PayPal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="transition-for-coin3"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transition for coin3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coin3D is a scene graph library and a fundamental part of FreeCAD.
Unfortunately, it hasn't had a release since 2011, but development has been
picking up recently, so it's likely that a release is not too far off. Even
without a formal release, several improvements have been made including CMake
support, so it's time to prepare a transition in advance of the Debian 10
release. Luckily, Leo Palomo-Avellaneda has taken the initiative of getting
this transition started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the new Coin3D package is available in Debian Experimental as we
prepare the reverse-dependencies to build against it. For FreeCAD, we directly
depend on Pivy, which are Python bindings for Coin. Pivy, in turn, depends on
Coin and SoQt, which is a Qt GUI component toolkit library for Coin. A
pre-release version of SoQt is also being packaged since, like Coin, CMake
support has been added, as well as support for Qt 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I've been grinding my gears on building Pivy against the new
Coin and SoQt for a good part of this month, which is especially troublesome
since FreeCAD's transition to Python 3 is blocked by the upload of a new Pivy,
which I prepared earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any luck, I'll be able to help Leo finish the Coin and SoQt transition and
have Pivy prepared in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gmsh-update"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gmsh Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gmsh is a 3D finite element mesh generator with built-in pre- and
post-processing facilities. It's also one of the main meshers used by FreeCAD's
Finite Element Modeling Workbench, besides Netgen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Debian has Gmsh 3.0.6, but a new major version was released in
August. I've already prepared this new major version for testing in FreeCAD's
Community Extras PPA, but I hadn't cleaned up the packaging yet to submit to
Debian. However, in November, there were two point releases, 4.0.5 and 4.0.6,
so I wasn't able to complete this work this month, but I'm sure it'll be done
in early December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major piece of information regarding Gmsh 4 is a change in the API: the
libjava-gmsh3 package in Debian was never meant to be a public API, and so Gmsh
upstream has requested that we no longer ship it. To offset this, there have
been refinements for the actual public API, which officially comes in C, Python
3 and (new) Julia flavors. However, I haven't found much information on Julia
packaging in Debian, so I'll likely hold off on that package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pyside-2-rebuild-ppa-plans"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PySide 2 Rebuild &amp;amp; PPA Plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since FreeCAD is an LGPL-licensed Qt project, we must use PySide and not PyQt
to do Qt things with Python. Because of this, the FreeCAD migration to Qt 5 on
Debian was blocked by the packaging of PySide 2, which was completed by
Freexian SARL over the summer. In Debian, we now have a Qt 5-enabled FreeCAD,
although our daily builds PPA is still using Qt 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the Qt 4-&amp;gt;5 transition, we're also finishing up a Python 2-&amp;gt;3
transition. At the end of the summer I published a &lt;cite&gt;freecad-python3&lt;/cite&gt; package in
the PPA which also used Qt 5. However, it wasn't really fully usable, moreso a
proof-of-concept that such a build indeed buildable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the Debian FreeCAD package has begun to diverge from the FreeCAD
PPAs; besides Qt 5 builds not being available currently, the Debian package has
also been split into several packages (e.g. &lt;cite&gt;libfreecad&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;freecad-common&lt;/cite&gt;,
etc. packages) in order to better comply with Debian Policy and the Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there's a bit of work to do to catch the PPAs up. First, the package split
needs to be done. Then, I need to upload an alternative &lt;cite&gt;freecad-daily&lt;/cite&gt; package
for Qt 5 builds, separate from Python 3. Once that is done and has undergone
some testing, &lt;cite&gt;freecad-daily&lt;/cite&gt; can be replaced by it, and it in turn can be
replaced by a &lt;cite&gt;freecad-python3&lt;/cite&gt; package for further testing. Since FreeCAD's
0.18 release is imminent, I'll need to get this taken care of during December,
so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="packaging-in-progress"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Packaging in Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first packaging list is all the software I've already started packaging. For
some, it's almost complete, and for others, I've only just begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of these lists is not to give status updates, but to announce what
all I'm interested in to anyone reading this, and to give an idea of how much
packaging work I have in mind to improve this usage of Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cantera"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;cantera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="homepage-github"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cantera.org/"&gt;Homepage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Cantera/cantera"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cantera is an open-source suite of tools for problems involving chemical
kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had this package working and waiting to be sponsored, but it looks like it currently fails
to build from source, so this just requires some maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coolprop"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;coolprop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.coolprop.org/"&gt;Homepage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
CoolProp is a thermophysical property database and wrappers for a selection
of programming environments. It offers similar functionality to REFPROP,
although CoolProp is open-source and free.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This package was previously building completely, but failing when one would attempt to do
an &lt;cite&gt;import coolprop&lt;/cite&gt;. Now that it's been a while since I worked with it, it
seems to be failing to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Elmer is a finite element software for numerical solution of partial
differential equations. Elmer is capable of handling any number of equations
and is therefore ideally suited for the simulation of multiphysical problems.
It includes models, for example, of structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, heat
transfer and electromagnetics. Users can also write their own equations that
can be dynamically linked with the main program.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was previously in Debian but removed due to abandonment, so a great deal
of the work is already done, but it also requires quite a bit of updating to
current Debian standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
IfcOpenShell is an open source (LGPL) software library that helps users and
software developers to work with the IFC file format. The IFC file format
can be used to describe building and construction data. The format is
commonly used for Building Information Modelling. IfcOpenShell uses
OpenCASCADE internally to convert the implicit geometry in IFC files into
explicit geometry that any software CAD or modelling package can
understand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;cite&gt;libprojectchrono&lt;/cite&gt;. Anyway, it's a rather large set of components which will be
broken up into several packages. Luckily, things are done in a pretty normal

to package the entire Salome Platform, but it's extremely large and really
several source packages. Packaging this as an intermediate step allows us to
remove SMESH from FreeCAD's included sources.&lt;/p&gt;

XC is an open source FEA program designed to solve structural analysis

&lt;p&gt;This library is supposed to be an alternative to the not-quite-freely licensed
OpenSees, which is used in seismic research and analysis. There has been some
interest in the FreeCAD forums about using this, so I'm beginning packaging it
in advance. However, it seems a bit complicated as it requires multiple

&lt;blockquote&gt;
lib2geom (2Geom in private life) was initially a library developed for
Inkscape but will provide a robust computational geometry framework for any
application. It is not a rendering library, instead concentrating on high
level algorithms such as computing arc length.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at this package and it seemed like it will be straightforward to
package, and with the parent project's popularity, someone else may get to it
first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Building Information Model server (short: BIMserver) enables you to
store and manage the information of a construction (or other building
related) project. Data is stored in the open standard IFC. The BIMserver is
not a fileserver, but it uses a model-driven architecture approach. This
means that IFC data is stored in an underlying database. The main advantage
of this approach is the ability to query, merge and filter the BIM-model
and generate IFC files on the fly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of BIM with FreeCAD is a very promising endeavor, and letting
FreeCAD be the client in a client-server model provides many potential
benefits. (This is the reason I'm working on PostCAD.) Packaging BIMserver
is a natural decision, then. However, it's a Java application, which I have
little experience with language-wise and none in terms of packaging it in
Debian, so this one has a bit of a difficulty associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use python based language for building
parametric 3D CAD models. CadQuery is for 3D CAD what jQuery is for
javascript. Imagine selecting Faces of a 3d object the same way you select
DOM objects with JQuery!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CadQuery is an interesting project which actually makes use of FreeCAD, and
indeed FreeCAD even has a CadQuery Workbench. This would be nice to package as
a way of extending the FreeCAD ecosystem on Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, CadQuery 2 is planning on moving away from FreeCAD to PythonOCC,
which is based on the now behind-the-times OpenCASCADE Community Edition fork,
based on OpenCASCADE 6.9.1; FreeCAD and other projects are moving back to the
mainline OpenCASCADE Technology project which is about to release version
7.4.0. It would be nice if both CadQuery and FreeCAD could instead move to use
PyOCCT as a middle-layer between itself and OpenCASCADE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This extension highlights the code snippets for over 350 languages in
LibreOffice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have packaged a LibreOffice extension before, and it was fairly easy, so I expect this one will be too. However its priority is rather low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lib3MF is a C++ implementation of the 3D Manufacturing Format file standard.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like a straightforward library to package, but there is no pressing need as FreeCAD does not support it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

MUESLI, a Material UnivErSal LIbrary, is a collection of C++ classes and

Developed at IMDEA Materials, it is available to the material science and
computational mechanics community as a suite of standard models and as a
platform for developing new ones.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like a great candidate package for Debian Science but I have had
some difficulty building it, which I need to conquer before packaging can
begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of Clang and LLVM
compiler infrastructure. Cling realizes the read-eval-print loop (REPL)
concept, in order to leverage rapid application development. Implemented as
a small extension to LLVM and Clang, the interpreter reuses their strengths
such as the praised concise and expressive compiler diagnostics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cling is an incredible project which should have been packaged already.
Hopefully someone else gets to it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landlab is a Python-based modeling environment that allows scientists and
students to build numerical landscape models. Designed for disciplines
that quantify earth surface dynamics such as geomorphology, hydrology,
glaciology, and stratigraphy, it can also be used in related fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landlab provides components to compute flows (such as water, sediment,
glacial ice, volcanic material, or landslide debris) across a gridded
terrain. With its robust, reusable components, Landlab allows scientists
to quickly build landscape model experiments and compute mass balance
across scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landlab is another interesting Debian Science candidate but I have no pressing need to package it.&lt;/p&gt;

A static website and blog generator, written in Python.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikola is what I use to create this blog, but it's somewhat fast moving and a

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In some European countries, CAD projects must have font which conform to
IS0 3O98 specification. Commercial CADs has this font, but free CADs not.
There is no available free font yet, so this project will fix this. This
font will be created completely from the scratch. Font is created with free
tools like FontForge, Inkscape, Gimp. Font is available under 3 licences:
GNU GPL licence version 3 with GPL font exception, GNU GPL licence version
2 with GPL font exception, GNU LGPL licence version 3 with GPL font
exception.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bundled font with FreeCAD, so I'd like to separate into its own
package. However, the need to package it is not pressing, so I haven't picked

&lt;blockquote&gt;
pigpio is a C library for the Raspberry which allows control of the General

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A logic analyser (digital waveform viewer).  piscope uses the services of
the pigpio library. pigpio needs to be running on the Pi whose gpios are to

&lt;p&gt;Being able to see the waveform of a GPIO pin on a Raspberry Pi is incredibly
useful for teaching robotics and electrical engineering classes with them. This

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The pyOCCT project provides Python bindings to the OpenCASCADE 7.2.0
geometry kernel and SMESH 8.3.0 meshing library via pybind11. Together,
this technology stack enables rapid CAD/CAE application development in the
popular Python programming language.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very promising library for Python OpenCASCADE development, so I'd
like to get it packaged, but it's blocked by getting SMESH packaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Quarter is a light-weight glue library that provides seamless integration
between the Coin high-level 3D visualization library and Qt's 2D user
interface library.  The functionality in Quarter revolves around
QuarterWidget, a subclass of QGLWidget. This widget provides functionality
for rendering of Coin scenegraphs and translation of QEvents into SoEvents.
Using this widget is as easy as using any other QWidget.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FreeCAD already uses an included (and slightly modified) copy of Quarter in its
source, so I'd like to package Quarter in a standalone fashion as part of
moving FreeCAD away from bundled copies in its source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
REBOUND is an N-body integrator, i.e. a software package that can integrate
the motion of particles under the influence of gravity. The particles can
represent stars, planets, moons, ring or dust particles. REBOUND is very
flexible and can be customized to accurately and efficiently solve many
problems in astrophysics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like a really great library to have in Debian Science, but it's not a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLint is a simple command-line linter which reads your SQL files and
reports any syntax errors or warnings it finds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, SQLint checks SQL against the ANSI syntax, and uses the
PostgreSQL SQL parser to achieve this. In time, we hope to add support for
non-standard SQL variants (e.g. MySQL). Contributions are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be a very useful utility to have in Debian, but I always write SQL without flaw the first try. (wink)&lt;/p&gt;

The Soil &amp;amp; Water Assessment Tool is a small watershed to river basin-scale
model used to simulate the quality and quantity of surface and ground water
and predict the environmental impact of land use, land management
practices, and climate change. SWAT is widely used in assessing soil
erosion prevention and control, non-point source pollution control and
regional management in watersheds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SWAT is a powerful research tool in agricultural engineering, among several
others I'm interested in eventually packaging for Debian. The planned package
will be based on a CMake-enabled fork of the upstream source, which is built
with Intel's Fortran compiler by default and also had to be adapted for
gfortran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Self hosted FLOSS fitness/workout and weight tracker written with Django&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very promising application which could be used as both a fitness
tracker as well as a weight/nutrition tracker, something along the lines of a
self-hosted MyFitnessPal. However, my other packaging priorities outweigh this
at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it! My mostly complete list of in-progress and wishlist
items for Debian packaging. If you have any feedback on packages on the list,
or want to get in touch with me, you can find me &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/thekurtwk"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or send me an email at kurt at kwk.systems.
I'll also be starting to stream my Debian &amp;amp; FreeCAD work very soon, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitch.tv/kkremitzki"&gt;subscribe
to me on Twitch&lt;/a&gt; to get notified when I go
live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;amp;t=23197"&gt;on the forums&lt;/a&gt;. This was especially salient
as I have a bit of pain interacting with parts of the FreeCAD Python API and improvements to it would
be a good long-term goal after finishing GSoC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;TestPartDesignApp.py&lt;/tt&gt; file I had been working in thus far needed splitting up,
as I was cramming almost every new test into it.
The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Mod/PartDesign/TestPartDesignApp.py"&gt;new version of this file&lt;/a&gt;
is a pretty nice indicator of the overall status of PartDesign test coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added some basic tests for datum tools, covering simple creation scenarios. While exploring the 4th datum
tool, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ShapeBinder&lt;/tt&gt;, I found a bug that causes a crash, so I will need to look into that shortly to see if it's an
easy fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;LinearPattern&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;PolarPattern&lt;/tt&gt; got 6 new tests each, covering all the major variations of sketch-
or primitive-based features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I added one new test for each of the dressup features, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Fillet&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Chamfer&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Draft&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Thickness&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the pull request summarizing my work: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/869"&gt;https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/869&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, I ended up running into several annoying issues. The LLDB debugging integration I previously wrote about
began showing some inexplicable errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
error caught in async handler 'exec ('continue',)'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/kurt/.config/nvim/bundles/repos/github.com/dbgx/lldb.nvim/rplugin/python/lldb_nvim/__init_
_.py", line 49, in _exec
    self.ctrl.safe_execute(args)
  File "/home/kurt/.config/nvim/bundles/repos/github.com/dbgx/lldb.nvim/rplugin/python/lldb_nvim/control

  File "/home/kurt/.config/nvim/bundles/repos/github.com/dbgx/lldb.nvim/rplugin/python/lldb_nvim/control
ler.py", line 94, in safe_call
    raise EventLoopError("Dead event loop!")
EventLoopError: Dead event loop!
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dbgx/lldb.nvim/issues/52"&gt;an issue on Github&lt;/a&gt; which refers to
a now-deleted comment in the author's original repository, stating the project was no longer being developed.
The question remains as to how it was working just fine when I began and only just now stopped working, but
the end result was that my debugger-editor integration was broken, which makes it quite a bit tougher to debug
the C++ side of the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option I had was to just use GDB as a standalone command line application, but it's really convenient, e.g.
to not have to manually type out file names and line numbers for breakpoints, and otherwise have your debugger
wired up to your editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this was inexplicably not working either! Basic features of GDB worked, but trying to specify breakpoints
to step through the code was not. I banged my head on this issue for a while until I figured up &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ccmake&lt;/tt&gt; to
take a look at my build options. The issue? Somehow, the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE&lt;/tt&gt;, which had been set to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Debug&lt;/tt&gt;,
was unset. So, I set it again and started the debug build, which takes quite a long time.
(Around 2 hours with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;make &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-j4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did more research on options for debugger integration. I found an interesting option called Pyclewn
which is a debugger front-end for (neo)vim. This option was attractive since I could have a unified front-end
to both my C++ debugger as well as a Python one. However, setup wasn't straightforward, so I continued searching
for a simpler option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I stumbled upon &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/contrib/gdb/neovim_gdb.vim"&gt;neovim_gdb.vim&lt;/a&gt;,
a simple combination of vim settings, available in the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;contrib&lt;/tt&gt; folder of the neovim repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that was taken care of, I started working on my original objective for the week. I found that the
PartDesign Pipe issue was being caused by the code checking for whether or not the Pipe's AuxillerySpine (sic)
was a part of the active body, but didn't check if the thing existed first. This resulted in a check to
see if a null pointer was part of the active body, which is never the case. Checking for existence first
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/848"&gt;resolved the issue&lt;/a&gt;. With that bug fixed, I also added
two tests each for PartDesign Pipe and Loft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="33%"&gt;
&lt;col width="28%"&gt;

&lt;th class="head"&gt;initial, current test count&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;status&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;datum tools&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0, 0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ready&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;add. &amp;amp; sub. features/primitives&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11, 15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ready&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;all additive &amp;amp; subtractive
features now have at least
one test&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;transformations&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3, 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ready&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;dressup features&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0, 0&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;0, 0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ready&lt;/td&gt;

I wasn't sure of the best way to represent my progress thus far, but I figure a table is an alright way to summarize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;

&lt;col width="28%"&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;

&lt;td&gt;0, 0&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;add. &amp;amp; sub. features/primitives&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3, 11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;blocked&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;basic Pipe not working; when
fixed, all tools in this
category (but not all their
options) will have test
coverage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;transformations&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0, 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ready&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mirrored added, still need
Linear and PolarPattern&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;dressup features&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0, 0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ready&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;boolean operation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0, 0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ready&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Previously seemed to
misbehave but recent changes
to containers may have fixed
this&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my Pad &amp;amp; Pocket tests added, so right now the total Δtests is 11. Next up is Loft and Pipe. However,
Pipe has a bit of a blocking bug right now. My test scenario involves a simple circle centered at the origin
in an XY-attached sketch, serving as the base Profile, and a simple line on the Z axis in an XZ-attached sketch.
The test construction is illustrated in figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should result in a cylinder, as the preview indicates in figure 2. For some reason, when clicking OK,
an external reference warning is being generated, and this is blocking any test constructions for PartDesign Pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="test pipe construction" src="/images/gsoc-3-3.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 1. PartDesign Pipe Profile and Spine sketches which should form a simple cylinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="external reference warning" src="/images/gsoc-3-4.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 2. PartDesign Pipe erroneously warning about external references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also ran into a bug in PartDesign Revolve, which, as bugs are wont to do, ended up being two bugs.
The construction case to see them is depicted in figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="revolution sketches" src="/images/gsoc-3-1.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 3. Simple sketches attached to the three base planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attached a simple circle sketch to each of the three base planes, and offset them so they wouldn't be symmetric
with respect to the origin or any base axes. When attempting to add a Revolution with these sketches, they behave
as expected, until one attempts to revolve them about the axis which is normal to the sketch's plane. For the
XY- and YZ-attached sketches, the following error appears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Unhandled Base::Exception caught in GUIApplication::notify.
The error message is: Rotation axis must not be perpendicular with the sketch plane&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if one tries to revolve the XZ-attached circle, FreeCAD gives it the ol' college try, but
ends up with an awfully thin "solid":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="faulty revolution" src="/images/gsoc-3-2.png" style="width: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 4. An "error-free" PartDesign Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll also be looking into these bugs this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>freecad</category><category>gsoc</category><guid>/blog/gsoc-week-3-recap/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2017 16:15:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC Week 2 recap</title><link>/blog/gsoc-week-2-recap/</link><dc:creator>Kurt Kremitzki</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the four major bugs blocking the usage of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;PartDesign Mirrored&lt;/tt&gt; fixed,
I started out the week exploring the now-functioning tool with the goal of getting what I call "command test coverage".
In short, this means testing major variations for tools presented to the user in the PartDesign WB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, they are depicted and categorized in figures 1 and 2,
with the newly redesigned icons made by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/agryson"&gt;Alexander Gryson&lt;/a&gt; (kudos to his major rework of all of FreeCAD's icons!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="command palette" src="/images/gsoc-2-1.png" style="width: 900px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 1. Datum tools, additive/subtractive features and primitives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="command palette" src="/images/gsoc-2-2.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 2. Transformations, dressup features, and multi-body boolean operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mirrored tool takes as input feature(s) and a mirror plane, but the other transformation tools like LinearPattern and PolarPattern behave in a fundamentally similar way.
By that reasoning, I figured that tests regarding the Mirrored tool really only have two major permutations if one assumes valid input:
the case where a choice of features and plane succeeds, and one where it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="mirrored success" src="/images/gsoc-2-3.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 3. Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="mirrored failure" src="/images/gsoc-2-4.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 4. Failure...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I cleaned up the test case submission I started GSoC out with, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;testMirroredSketchCase&lt;/tt&gt;,
and added the new case depicted in figure 4, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;testMirroredOffsetFailureCase&lt;/tt&gt;.
However, I noticed both of my test cases involved &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Sketch&lt;/tt&gt;-based additive features, but no additive primitives.
So, I also included &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;testMirroredPrimitiveCase&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/816"&gt;FreeCAD PR#816&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's nice is that besides &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;PartDesign Mirrored&lt;/tt&gt; now being fixed, several other transformation tools' bugs were resolved.
Altogether, the PR resolved four issues, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/tracker/view.php?id=2235"&gt;2235&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/tracker/view.php?id=2248"&gt;2248&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/tracker/view.php?id=3006"&gt;3006&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/tracker/view.php?id=3065"&gt;3065&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that wrapped up,
I moved on to adding tests for the various options for the fundamental sketch-based features &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Pad&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Pocket&lt;/tt&gt;.
Altogether, I added &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;testPadToFirstCase&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;testPadtoLastCase&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;testPadToFaceCase&lt;/tt&gt;,
and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;testPadTwoDimensionsCase&lt;/tt&gt; to cover the options for &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;PartDesign Pad&lt;/tt&gt;.
Unfortunately, these test cases are not very interesting to look at and mostly involve 2-4 lined up cubes similar to
what figure 3 looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;PartDesign Pad&lt;/tt&gt;, things do get a little more interesting.
The base case is a simple reversed pad with a pocket in the middle, shown in figure 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="mirrored failure" src="/images/gsoc-2-5.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 5. The base Pocket test construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was straightforward to add &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;testPocketDimensionCase&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;testPocketThroughAllCase&lt;/tt&gt;,
and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;testPocketToFirstCase&lt;/tt&gt;.
However, covering the last Pocket option with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;testPocketToFaceCase&lt;/tt&gt; is not (necessarily) so trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you refer to figure 5, you'll note that the base Pad feature is a hexahedron, or six-sided shape.
The Pocket feature adds four new faces to the overall shape, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Face7&lt;/tt&gt; through &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Face10&lt;/tt&gt;.
However, references relying on the numbering of those faces is inherently brittle and it turns out that
a particular face number OpenCASCADE &amp;gt; 7.0 does not correspond to the same face in a lower version, e.g.
the version used on the FreeCAD CI machines over at Travis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>freecad</category><category>gsoc</category><guid>/blog/gsoc-week-2-recap/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2017 23:40:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GSoC Week 1 Recap</title><link>/blog/gsoc-week-1-recap/</link><dc:creator>Kurt Kremitzki</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first week of Google Summer of Code has ended, and so it's time for a recap post!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main topic this week was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/PartDesign_Mirrored"&gt;PartDesign Mirrored&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly self-explanatory feature,
with a show-stopping bug explained in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://freecadweb.org/tracker/view.php?id=3006"&gt;FreeCAD issue 3006&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="unit cube construction" src="/images/gsoc-1-1.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 1. The base of my PartDesign Mirrored experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this picture, we have a simple &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;1 mm&lt;/tt&gt; square sketch (pictured in white) attached to the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(xy\)&lt;/span&gt;-plane.
One corner is at the origin, and the sketch is the base for a Pad feature &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;1 mm&lt;/tt&gt; high.
Length is handled internally as &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;mm&lt;/tt&gt; by FreeCAD, so this "unit cube" serves as a useful basis for testing behavior.
A useful alteration involves displacing this cube, say, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;1 mm&lt;/tt&gt; up the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;-axis.
This constructs a case where mirroring not all mirrorings should succeed, but we'll get into that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's turn now to the bug itself, depicted in figure 2.
The unit cube is supposed to be mirrored about its vertical sketch axis (the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;-axis, pictured running off to the top right.)
Obviously, it's not, and the failure is helpfully represented in red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="mirroring bug" src="/images/gsoc-1-2.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 2. FreeCAD bug 3006 in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the body diagonal of the mirrored part should run from the origin to  &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((-1, 1, 1)\)&lt;/span&gt;.
Instead, it's going to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((1, -1, -1)\)&lt;/span&gt;, in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this was my first really serious bug to tackle for the summer.
I chose this as a way to really dive in, since it directly involves Open CASCADE, the open source C++ geometry kernel at the heart of FreeCAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my programming background is chiefly with Python (as well as JavaScript and Lua), all interpreted languages.
One nicety of that sort of language is that it can be very quick to debug and examine behavior using the interpreter.
There is a Python debugger, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pdb&lt;/tt&gt;, but I rarely needed to use it for my mostly personal-sized projects.
Even then, it's quite straightforward to use since you're already in an interpreter-native environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C++ is a very different beast. In this case, stepping through the code with a debugger was my only choice.
I use Neovim as my IDE, though, so I wanted a way to combine the power of my text editor with my debugger.
So, I found and set up &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dbgx/lldb.nvim"&gt;LLDB.nvim&lt;/a&gt;, an LLDB frontend, with an event-based, non-blocking UI,
session-saving, and
"... takes advantage of Neovim's job API to spawn a separate process and communicates with the Neovim process using RPC calls."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty nice. Anyway, I was able to step through the code and see exactly what was flying around, just like I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="neovim" src="/images/neovim1.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 3. Neovim in an LLDB debug session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what was the problem? Hah! Not so simple. Turns out there are &lt;em&gt;at least four bugs here!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the algorithm which first checks if the mirrored shapes are adjacent and thus, can be fused, was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this failed, FreeCAD then attempts to generate a mesh from the shape, and then converts a generalized transformation object representing the mirroring into a matrix to put the mesh in the correct place.
It turns out that in Open CASCADE 7.0.0, the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;gp_Trsf&lt;/tt&gt; API was changed so that &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;gp_Trsf::VectorialPart()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; returns a 3x3 matrix including the scale factor.
The previous behavior was to return the homogeneous part of the transformation which does not include the scale factor, and the FreeCAD algorithm for constructing the 4x4 matrix for the mesh included multiplying every term by a scale factor.
In other words, the scale factor multiplication was happening twice. The scale factor I had observed in the debugger was -1, so this perfectly explained the inverted positioning of the failure result!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third bug, of a much more minor nature, involved a a classic "failure... success!" message displayed in the event of a mirroring failure, and was easier to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth, though, was a bit trickier! It only appeared when fixing the mesh placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="new mirroring bug" src="/images/gsoc-1-3.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 4. A strange, new mirroring bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was diagnosed by ickby, my mentor for this project.
It turns out the failure meshes' faces were getting constructed inside out, and so the material's color was not considered "illuminated".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three of us considered a few different options to get around this. One way would be to use Coin3D, FreeCAD's scene graph library, and change the material
properties to define something that looked the same, illuminated or not. Another is to essentially duplicate each face with the second instance having an inverted normal, so that you're guaranteed to have an outward-facing face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix ended up being much simpler than that! It was possible to simply change the vertex ordering. Originally, it was set to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;COUNTERCLOCKWISE&lt;/tt&gt;.
However, in figure 4, you can see that simply changing it to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;CLOCKWISE&lt;/tt&gt; would not be an obvious fix.
Abdullah also fixed this one, presumably by checking the docs for that option and finding that there was an "option C", &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;UNKNOWN&lt;/tt&gt;. That did the trick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, PartDesign Mirrored is fixed and ready. Not a bad start for the summer!&lt;/p&gt;

as well. It's been a busy year: I've been studying machine design, robotics; partial differential
equations in general, and heat and mass transfer in particular. I've also been studying the source
code of FreeCAD while honing my sysadmin skills by helping maintain project infrastructure.
My hard work has paid off, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5752969237626880"&gt;my Google Summer of Code project proposal &lt;/a&gt;
was accepted! I'm going to be working on improving the parametric part design workbench and writing
test code to make the module more robust for future development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I've decided to publish my daily log here. I'll be posting weekly summaries once the
coding period begins on May 30, as well as more in-depth ad hoc blogging on interesting developments over the summer.
My goal is to both document my project and to produce a useful reference for other developers wanting to get started
contributing to FreeCAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of May is part of the Community Bonding Period, and so I'll ramp up to full speed with an introductory series
of posts. Here are a few rough-draft titles to highlight my planned topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/distcc/distcc"&gt;Neovim&lt;/a&gt; as an IDE:&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building your base, or practically pluginless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes an IDE? An overview of features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unix as an IDE, or knowing your tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neovim with Python 2 and 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neovim with C++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous autobuilding with Neovim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed compilation with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/distcc/distcc"&gt;distcc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking source code: how to fix your first FreeCAD bug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributing to open source communities (and FreeCAD in particular)&lt;/li&gt;
