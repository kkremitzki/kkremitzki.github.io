# Why You Should
Debian is the upstream of several other Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint.
Improvements made to Debian improve the entire Debian-family ecosystem.

Debian Unstable represents the tip of Debian development; it is a rolling release distribution
where packages become available as soon as they are uploaded and built. Because of that, it earns
its name 'Unstable' and can be more difficult to use than, say, an Ubuntu LTS, but it also
provides the opportunity to hone one's skills and participate in Debian development, and those
skills can be readily transferred if one wishes to contribute to Ubuntu or any other Debian-family
distro.

# Getting Started
